               In all cases in which the board of commissioners, under the authority of this article,
               causes the demolition and removal of any building or structure to be carried out,
               or directs such other remedial steps to be taken as may be necessary to abate the
               nuisance and remove the hazards, it shall be conclusively presumed that the public
               nuisance and the fire and safety hazard and danger to life, health and other property,
               created and maintained by the continued presence of the building or structure, in
               such condition as is found to exist, constitutes a clear and present danger amounting
               to a situation of emergency involving the public health, safety and general welfare,
               which requires entry upon private property for the summary abatement and removal of
               such danger, in the public interest.
