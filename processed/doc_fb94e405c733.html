               The securing of goods and services necessary to the operation of county government
               is a major administrative responsibility. Under the supervision of the finance director,
               this function of county government is the primary responsibility of purchasing.

               Statutory provisions regulating purchasing by local governments are contained primarily
               in G.S. Â§Â§ 143-129 through 143-135. Other specific duties, responsibilities and authorities
               are contained in G.S. chapters 14, 44, 66, 75, 87, 105, 153, 160A, and 159. By virtue
               of these statutes, the county is empowered to enter into contracts for the procurement
               of materials and services. The board of commissioners has full budget authority to
               sign such contracts. Authority to sign contracts for procurement of supplies and services
               has been delegated to the county manager.

               Prior to entering into any agreement or making any purchase, the county must first
               have funds appropriated to meet financial obligations. Contracts or purchase orders
               requiring the payment of funds for supplies or materials may not be made unless a
               proper appropriation appears in the budget and a sufficient unencumbered balance remains
               in the appropriation.
