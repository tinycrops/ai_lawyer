               two years of the franchise term. The franchised collector may thereafter submit a
               non-binding request to the county commissioners for an increase if the percent change
               in the annual consumer price index for all urban consumers goes above five percent
               since the start of the contract or the last increase, whichever is later. The index

               such other evidence as the board of commissioners may, in its discretion, allow or
