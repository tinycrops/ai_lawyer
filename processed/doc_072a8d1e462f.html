               An alarm user may appeal assessment of an administrative processing fee to the alarm
               administrator by filing a written request for hearing identifying the basis for the
               appeal within ten days after assessment of the fee. The filing of a request for an
               appeal hearing with the alarm administrator shall stay the assessment of the fee until
               the alarm administrator, or alarm review authority on appeal, makes a final decision.

               The alarm administrator shall review the circumstances surrounding the issuance of
               the fee assessment and may conduct a formal hearing and consider the evidence presented
               by any interested person(s). The alarm administrator shall enter his/her decision
               on the preponderance of evidence found through his/her assessment of the circumstances
               or presented at the hearing including, but not limited to, evidence that a false alarm
               dispatch arose from a defective part that has been repaired or replaced or that an
               alarm dispatch request arose from an actual emergency. The alarm administrator shall
               render a decision within 30 days after the receipt of the request for a review. The
               alarm administrator shall affirm, reverse or modify the assessment of the fee. The
               decision of the alarm administrator may be appealed to the alarm review authority
               if written notice is given to the authority within 20 days after he/she renders a
               decision on the appeal. Actions and decisions by the alarm review authority are final
               administrative decisions by the county.
