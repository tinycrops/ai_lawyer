               By written notice to the advisory board, a landowner of qualifying farmland may revoke
               the preservation agreement or the advisory board may revoke the same preservation
               agreement based on noncompliance by the landowner, subject to the same provisions
               as contained in<a href="" data-chunk-id="PTIICOOR_CH4AG_S4-7APAPAPPR" class="section-link" data-product-id="14529"> section 4-7</a> for appeal of denials. Such revocation shall result in loss of qualifying farm status
               and loss of eligibility to participate in a district. Absent noncompliance by the
               landowner, neither the advisory board nor the board of commissioners shall revoke
               any preservation agreements prior to its expiration.
