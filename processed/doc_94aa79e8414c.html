               Under this article no poles shall be erected by the grantee without prior approval
               of the county with regard to location, height, types and any other pertinent aspect.
               However, no location of any pole or wire-holding structure of the grantee shall give
               rise to a vested interest, and such poles or structures shall be removed or modified
               by the grantee at its own expense whenever the county determines that the public convenience
               would be enhanced thereby.

               Where poles are available for use in serving the county by the grantee, but it does
               not make arrangements for such use, the county may require the grantee to use such
               poles and structures if it determines that the public convenience would be enhanced
               thereby and the terms of the use available to the grantee are just and reasonable.
