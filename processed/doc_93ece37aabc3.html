               <span class="ital">Delay and/or denial of materials permitted.</span> From time to time certain solid waste may arrive at the landfill and/or container
               sites which, in the judgment of the operators of the site, would be hazardous or detrimental
               to personnel or operations. Such operator may delay the unloading of such wastes until
               the general services director, or his representative, has the opportunity to review
               the situation and decide upon the disposition of the waste. Upon the decision of the
               disposition, appeal may be made to the county manager, whose decision shall be final
               and subject to no appeal.

               as to where certain types of solid waste are unloaded. Persons delivering wastes to
               the landfill shall be required to discharge the waste at locations as directed by
               the operator. This provision shall under no circumstance empower landfill site operators
               to require that drivers make or attempt maneuvers that would abuse or injure equipment
               or would jeopardize the driver or equipment.
