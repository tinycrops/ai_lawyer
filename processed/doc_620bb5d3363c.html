               The county reserves the right to call upon and mobilize the resources of any franchised
               ambulance provider in the event of any disaster, catastrophe or other exigent circumstances
               for which county resources are inadequate to respond. In such instance the county
               would assume operational control of all ambulance activities and provide for reimbursement
               of uncollectible accounts arising out of such activities at the approved rates and
               charges in effect at the time of service.
