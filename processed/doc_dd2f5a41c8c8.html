               current vaccination against rabies. If the dog, cat or ferret is confined on its owner's
               or keeper's premises, an animal control officer may revisit the premises for inspection
               purposes during the confinement period. If the owner or keeper fails to provide continuous
               quarantine of the dog, cat or ferret on his or her premises as instructed, the animal
               shall be removed by an animal control officer and quarantined at a veterinary hospital

               confinement on the owner or keeper's property.
