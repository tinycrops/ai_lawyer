               If the same person conducts the land-disturbing activity and any related borrow or
               waste activity, the related borrow or waste activity shall constitute part of the
               land-disturbing activity, unless the borrow or waste activity is regulated under the
               Mining Act of 1971, G.S. ch. 74, art. 7, or is a landfill regulated by the division
               of waste management. If the land-disturbing activity and any related borrow or waste
               activity are not conducted by the same person, they shall be considered by the approving
               authority as separate land-disturbing activities.
