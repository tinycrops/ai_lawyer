               Specific requests for recommendations may be made from time to time by the board of
               commissioners to the planning board. Such requests may require that the recommendations
               be submitted within a stated time period. However, if after expiration of the time
               period, no recommendation shall have been submitted, the board of commissioners may
               take such final action with respect to the matter submitted as it deems wise.
