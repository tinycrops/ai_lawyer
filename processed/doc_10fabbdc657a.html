               The emergency management director shall issue an order banning the recreational, commercial,
               or navigational boating on or recreational use of all or any part of the rivers in
               the county's jurisdiction at such time as he determines that flooding is likely to
               occur or is occurring. The determination shall take into consideration recognized
               standards for the issuance of an advisory flood notice to the public or affected persons.
               The emergency management director may also consider any information which may be available
               from the flood warning system. The emergency management director's authority shall
               include the authority to selectively ban recreational, commercial or navigational
               activities in limited river areas when he finds that the danger is limited to those
               areas. The emergency management director shall be authorized to appoint a designee
               to act in his absence in discharging the duties required of him under this article.

               The order providing for a ban shall be effective upon its posting at the county courthouse.
               The emergency management director shall secure publication of the order in a newspaper
               of wide circulation. Such notice shall be made available to radio and television stations
               for public dissemination. Each order shall on its face provide for an expiration date,
               which date shall not exceed five days from the date of posting. The order may be reissued
               should flood conditions persist, and each reissued order shall comply with the publication,
               posting and expiration provisions of this section.
