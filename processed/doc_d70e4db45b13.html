               be recorded by the register of deeds of the county until it has been approved as provided
               herein. To secure such approval of a final plat, the subdivider shall follow the procedure
               established in this article. Furthermore, no street shall be accepted for ownership
               or maintenance, nor shall water, sewer, or other public facilities or services be
               extended to or connected with any subdivision for which a final plat is required to
               be approved unless and until such plat has been approved.

               assistance of the planning department and other applicable departments in order to
               facilitate the subsequent preparation and approval of the sketch plan, preliminary
               plat, or final plat. Such consultation is recommended for subdivisions over ten acres
               in size or containing more than 25 proposed lots. The pre-application consultation
               does not require formal application or fee.
