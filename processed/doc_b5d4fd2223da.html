               If the county shall grant to the grantee a nonexclusive, revocable franchise to construct,
               operate, and maintain a cable communications system within the county, the franchise
               shall constitute both a right and an obligation to provide the services of a cable
               communications system as regulated by this article and the franchise. The franchise
               shall include by reference those provisions of the grantee's "application for franchise"
               that are finally negotiated and accepted by the county and the grantee.

               fees to be paid, or manner of construction.
