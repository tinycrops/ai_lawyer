               The purpose of this chapter is to promote agricultural values and the general welfare
               of the county and more specifically, increase identity and pride in the agricultural
               community and its way of life; encourage the economic and financial health of agriculture;
               and increase protection from non-farm development and other negative impacts on properly
               managed farms.

               <span class="ital">Enhanced voluntary agricultural district.</span> The enhanced voluntary agricultural district ordinance creates a district that will
               provide greater benefits to farmers than the current program. Participating farms
               will be allowed to receive up to 25 percent of their gross sales from certain types
               of non-farm products and still qualify for agricultural zoning exemptions and be eligible
               for a higher percentage of cost-share program funding and have priority for other
               state grant programs.
