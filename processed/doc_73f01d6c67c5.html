               word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual
               working control in whatever manner exercised. A rebuttable presumption that a transfer
               of control has occurred shall arise upon the disposal by the grantee, directly or
               indirectly, by gift, assignment, voluntary sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise,
               of 25 percent or more at one time of the ownership or controlling interest in the
               system, or 50 percent cumulatively over the term of the franchise of such interests
               to a corporation, partnership, limited partnership, trust or association, or person
               or group of persons acting in concert.

               subject to cancellation unless and until the county shall have consented thereto,
               which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether
               it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the county may
               inquire into the legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest
               qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the grantee shall assist
               the county in any such inquiry. Failure to provide all information reasonably requested
               by the county as part of said inquiry may be grounds for denial of the proposed change,
               transfer or acquisition of control as provided herein or by federal laws and regulations.

               the franchise shall have the right to notify the county that it or its designees satisfactory
               to the county will take control and operate the cable television system. Further,
               said financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation that will insure
               continued service and compliance with all franchise obligations during the term the
               financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution
               shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one year, unless
               extended by the county at its discretion and during said period of time it shall have
               the right to petition for transfer of the franchise to another grantee. If the county
               finds that such transfer, after considering the legal, financial, character, technical
               and other public interest qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory, the county
               will transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise as in the public
               interest. The consent of the county to such transfer shall not be unreasonably withheld.
