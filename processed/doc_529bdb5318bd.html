               Except for under-the-sink grease interceptors, each interceptor shall be located outside
               of a building or structure in an area accessible for service, and so installed and
               connected that it shall be at all times easily accessible for inspection and for cleaning
               and removal of the intercepted waste. Inlet flow control inspection ports, interceptor
               inspection ports and effluent monitoring ports shall be in areas where the use of
               ladders or the removal of bulky equipment or stored materials as required to inspect
               inlet flow control devices, inspect or service interceptors, or sample interceptor
               effluent. Inspection ports and monitoring ports shall be located so as to allow inspectors
               quick and easy access to the inlet inflow control device, each component of the interceptor,
               and the effluent from the interceptor. An interceptor shall not be installed in any
               part of a building where food is handled. The location of all interceptors, inspection
               ports, and monitoring ports must be approved by the general services director.
