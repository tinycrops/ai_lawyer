               The county shall give grantee prompt notice of any claim or the commencement of any
               action, suit or other proceeding covered by the provisions of this section. The grantee
               shall be afforded the opportunity to control the defense of any such claim or action
               including, but not limited to any settlements, or compromise thereof; provided, however,
               that in the event grantee proposes or finds acceptable any settlement, compromise
               or resolution which the county deems detrimental to its interest, then in such event,
               county shall assume control of the defense of any such claim or action at its sole
               cost and expense, and the grantee's indemnity for the final resolution of such claim
               or action shall be limited to that settlement or compromise amount proposed or found
               acceptable by grantee but to which the county objected. Nothing herein shall be deemed
               to prevent the county from cooperating with the grantee and participating in the defense
               of any litigation by its own counsel at its own costs and expense. The county may
               take such steps in any proceeding as it deems essential to protect the county's or
               the public's interests. No recovery by the county of any sum by reason of the liquidated
               damages required by the franchise shall be subject to litigation by the grantee, except
               that any sum so received by the county shall be deducted from any recovery which the
               county might have against the grantee under the terms of this section.
