               Any person appointed to a board or commission by the board of commissioners, which
               board or commission was not created by the county, yet which has a designated membership
               for a county representative, shall submit a report of each meeting to the clerk to
               the board of commissioners. Such appointee has a responsibility to the board making
               such appointment and must notify the clerk immediately if the board or commission
               takes any action that may affect the county. Such report shall be due within one week
               after each regular or special meeting. If the appointee is absent, the report must
               include a review of the proposed agenda and state the reason for such absence. If
               more than one county appointee is on the board or commission, the senior member shall
               be responsible for the report, except, in his absence, the report shall be filed by
               another county-appointee present at the meeting.
