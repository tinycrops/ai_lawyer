               A GESC is a contracting and financing method for the repair or upgrade of existing
               buildings (not new construction) that involves energy-saving improvements where the
               total cost of the contract is paid for with the energy savings, and the contractor
               guarantees the amount of the energy savings over the life of the contract. A special
               request for proposal process is required for advertising, evaluating and awarding
               a GESC (G.S. 143-64.17, G.S. 143-64.17A, G.S. 143-64.17B; G.S. 143-129(e)(8)).
