               The county commissioners, upon the recommendation of the hazardous waste and/or low-level
               radioactive waste board, shall from time to time assess permit applicants additional
               fees as the commissioners shall find necessary and sufficient to reimburse the county
               for the cost of any needed professional assistance that may be required by the county
               to evaluate the permit application and amendments, verify its contents and evaluate
               the impact of such a permit on the community, public health and the environment. This
               assistance may include, but shall not be limited to, the assistance of lawyers, biologists,
               engineers, chemists, hydrologists, emergency response, transportation and public health
