               The board of commissioners of the county has heretofore established and now maintains
               a county animal shelter. Such animal shelter is to be under the supervision and control
               of the county animal services director and shall be used for the purpose of impounding
               lost and stray dogs, cats, and other animals for a period of not less than seventy-two
               (72) hours. The county animal services director shall make every effort to locate
               and give notice to owners of such dogs, cats, or other animals of the impoundment
               of such dog or dogs, cat or cats, or other animals.
