               It is hereby declared to be the intention of the board of commissioners that the sections,
               paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases of this Code are severable, and if any
               phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section of this Code is declared unconstitutional
               or invalid by the valid judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction,
               such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining phrases,
               clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code, since the same would have
               been enacted by the board of commissioners without the incorporation in this Code
               of any such unconstitutional or invalid phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section.
