               room shall be eight (8) percent of the floor area of such room. Whenever walls or
               other portions of structures face a window or any room and such light-obstructing
               structures are located less than five (5) feet from the window and extend to a level
               above that of the ceiling of the room, such a window shall not be deemed to face directly
               to the outdoors and shall not be included as contributing to the required minimum
               total window area. Whenever the only window in a room is a skylight-type window in
               the top of such room, the total window area of such skylight shall equal at least
               fifteen (15) percent of the total floor area of such room.
