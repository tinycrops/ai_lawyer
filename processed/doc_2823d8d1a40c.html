               The local administrator may revoke and require the return of the development permit
               by notifying the permit holder in writing, stating the reason for the revocation.
               Permits shall be revoked for any substantial departure from the approved application,
               plans or specifications, for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of
               state or local laws or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing
               the permit. Any permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local
               law may also be revoked.
