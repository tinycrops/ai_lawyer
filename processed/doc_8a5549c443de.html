               The county shall not be liable to any consumer, owner or other person for the failure
               to furnish water for any purpose or under any condition, or for the quantity or quality
               of water furnished or for any damage that may result from the shutting off of water
               or reservoirs, even though no notice of the shutting off of water shall have been
               given. All permits and contracts for the use of water from the water system of the
               county are expressly made subject to this provision. Where possible, the county will
               give notice of its intent to shut down water facilities which will result in a stoppage
               or reduction in service.
