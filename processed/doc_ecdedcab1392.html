               In order to ensure adequate solid waste collection service in all of the unincorporated
               areas of the county, the board of commissioners may grant one or more exclusive solid
               waste collection rights to a person or qualified firm in the designated franchise

               include areas that lie outside of the corporate limits of the municipalities within

               or incorporated during the term of a franchise, that area shall then be expressly
               excluded from the designated franchise area. A map showing the current franchised
               areas is available upon request from the director of solid waste.
