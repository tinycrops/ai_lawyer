               <span class="ital">Posting bond.</span> Any person claiming an ownership interest in any animal confined pursuant to this
               article may prevent the disposition of the animal after the three business day holding
               period set forth herein by posting a security bond or cash with the animal shelter
               prior to the animal being adopted or euthanized in an amount sufficient to guarantee
               payment of all of the reasonable expenses expected to be incurred in caring and providing
               for the animal, including the estimated cost of medical care, for at least 30 days;
               However, such security bond shall not prevent the animal shelter from disposing of
               the animal at the end of the 30-day period covered by the posted bond/cash, unless
               the person claiming an ownership interest in the animal posts an additional security
               bond or cash with the animal shelter to secure payment of the animal's reasonable
               expenses for an additional 30 days, and does so prior to the expiration of the first
               30-day period. The amount of the bond/cash shall be determined by the director of
               the animal shelter or his/her designee based on the current rate for board and on
               the condition of the animal after examination by a veterinary professional. Failure
               to post the security bond within the time allowed shall result in the animal being
               immediately forfeited to the animal shelter. The owner must comply with any order
               issued by the sheriff or his designee and pay all fees, costs and fines before the
               animal may be released from the animal shelter. If the date on which payment is due
               falls on a weekend or holiday then such bond or deposit must be posted on the next
               business day.

               end of each security period, the security bond already posted shall be forfeited to
               the animal shelter on said date and used to pay the remaining unpaid fees, costs,
               and penalties owing for the animal. The animal's owner shall remain responsible for
               all remaining unpaid fees, costs, and penalties. Any security bond/cash remaining
               after the payment of all fees, costs, and penalties shall be remitted to the person
               who posted the bond/cash.
