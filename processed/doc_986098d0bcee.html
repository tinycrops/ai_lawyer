               The county shall require to be provided and operated at the user's own expense monitoring
               facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer
               and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated
               on the user's premises, but the county may, when such a location would be impractical
               or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public
               street and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
