               Compliance with construction and technical standards. Under this article the grantee
               shall construct, install, operate and maintain its system in a manner consistent with
               all laws, ordinances, construction standards, governmental requirements, Federal Communications
               Commission technical standards, and detailed technical standards submitted by the
               grantee as part of its application, which standards are incorporated by reference
               in this article. The grantee, through the system, shall provide uniform, strong signals
               which are free from any significant distortion and interference. The system shall
               be designed, constructed, operated and maintained for continuous operation 24 hours
               a day. The system shall produce, for reception on subscribers' receivers which are
               in good working order, either monochrome or color pictures (providing the receiver
               is color capable) which are free from any significant interference or distortion which
               would cause any material degradation of video or audio quality.
