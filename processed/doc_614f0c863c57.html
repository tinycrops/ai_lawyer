               When the county manager finds that a licensee has violated this article or the conditions
               of the license, the county manager shall give the licensee written notice of the violation
               and inform him that if another violation occurs within 30 days, or in the case of
               a continuing violation, if it is not corrected within ten days, the license will be
               revoked. If another violation occurs within the 30-day period, or, if the continuing
               violation is not corrected within ten days, the county manager shall give the licensee
               written notice that the license is revoked. Upon receipt of the notice of revocation,
               the licensee shall stop collecting, transporting, or disposing of solid waste. The
               county manager may reinstate a revoked license after the revocation has been in effect
               for 30 days if the director finds that the conditions causing the violation have been
               corrected. A licensee whose license has been revoked may appeal the revocation to
               the board of county commissioners by giving written notice of appeal to the county
               manager within ten days of receiving notice of revocation from the county manager.
               After a hearing on the appeal, the board shall either affirm the revocation or direct
               the county manager to reinstate the license.
