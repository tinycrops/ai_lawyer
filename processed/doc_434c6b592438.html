               A permit shall expire one year from the date of issuance, and shall be renewed annually
               by submitting an updated application and a permit renewal fee to the alarm administrator.
               The alarm administrator shall notify each alarm user of the need to renew 30 days
               prior to the expiration of the permit. The alarm user shall submit an application
               prior to the permit expiration date. Failure to renew shall constitute use of a non-permitted
               alarm system and citations and penalties shall be assessed without waiver. A violation
               of this section is punishable as a misdemeanor.
