               It is the intent of these regulations both to safeguard existing and potential development
               in appropriate locations and to preserve and to promote a desirable ecological balance.
               Insofar as is reasonably practicable, subdivisions shall, therefore, be located, designed
               and improve to preserve important natural water areas and related vegetation and wildlife
               habitats, to avoid creation of upstream impoundment or downstream runoff harmful to
               such complexes or to existing or potential development in appropriate locations, and
               to maintain desirable groundwater levels.
