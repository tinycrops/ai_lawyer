               Solid waste, in all its forms, left in public areas or other visible areas lessen
               the attractive appearance of the county. In a similar manner, such wastes, vehicles,
               and structures become an attractive nuisance for criminal activity, health hazards,
               and breeding grounds for rodents and other pathogen-carrying pests. It is the policy
               of the board to set such regulations and prohibitions as is found herein to protect
               the health, safety and welfare of all county citizens, especially small children who
               may be attracted to such structures, vehicles, and areas. It is the policy of the
               county to take an active role in the enforcement of this chapter to preserve the sense
               of place and community that is the county.
