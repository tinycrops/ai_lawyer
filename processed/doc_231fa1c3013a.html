               of any license acquired under this division, he shall submit a written recommendation
               of revocation to the board of county commissioners, and shall forward a copy of his
               recommendation to the licensee, by registered mail, at least ten (10) days prior to
               the hearing. The recommendation shall state the specific grounds for the revocation
               of the license.

               Cause for revocation of the license shall exist for the failure of the licensee to
               perform any duty required by this article, for violation of any provision of this
               article, or for conviction of the licensee of any crime involving moral turpitude.
               Grounds shall also exist if, by reason of the nature or the manner or place in which
               the licensee conducts business, a nuisance and menace to good order, public health,
               safety or morals is created.

               The board of commissioners, whenever it has good cause to believe there exist grounds
               for revocation of any license acquired under this division, may, upon its own motion,
               set a hearing, as provided in this section, for the licensee to show good cause why
               such license should not be revoked. Written notice stating the specific alleged grounds
               for revocation shall be forwarded by registered mail to the licensee at least ten
               (10) days prior to such hearing, which shall be held in exactly the same manner as
               if initiated by the sheriff.

               Prior to revocation of any license by the board of commissioners, the licensee shall

               to rebut any evidence against him, and to present evidence and witnesses in his defense.
               If the licensee fails to show good cause why his license should not be revoked, the
               board of commissioners may revoke the license upon a finding by the board of a cause
               for revocation.
