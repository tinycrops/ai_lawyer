               All prohibitions and restrictions imposed by authority of this section shall take
               effect in the emergency area immediately upon publication of the declaration unless
               the declaration sets a later time. For the purpose of requiring compliance, publication
               may consist of reports of the substance of the prohibitions and restrictions in the
               mass communications media serving the emergency area or other effective methods of
               disseminating the necessary information quickly. As soon as practicable, however,
               appropriate distribution of the full text of any declaration shall be made.
