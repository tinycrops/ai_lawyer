               Cleveland County acknowledges the need to address the permanent presence of community
               cats living in an outdoor environment, independent of human intervention. Management
               programs to reduce the uncontrolled reproduction of community cats shall be implemented
               by the animal services director to provide for the sterilization and return-to-field
               of all healthy community cats entering the county shelter.

               Community cats shall be held for the mandatory holding period established by the state
               and then sterilized, ear-tipped, vaccinated, and returned to the original point of
               pick-up by an animal services staff person or released to an approved rescue group.
               However, any community cat determined to be a nuisance by the department shall be
               relocated to an alternate suitable outdoor location.
