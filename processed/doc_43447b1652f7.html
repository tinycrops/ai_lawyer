               An appeal from any decision or order of the building code administrator may be taken
               by any person aggrieved thereby. Any appeal from the building code administrator shall
               be taken within ten days from the rendering of the decision or service of the order,
               and shall be taken by filing with the building code administrator and with the housing
               appeals board a notice of appeal which shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal
               is based. Upon the filing of any notice of appeal, the building code administrator
               shall forthwith transmit to the housing appeals board all the paper constituting the
               record upon which the decision appealed from was made. When an appeal is from a decision
               of the building code administrator refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby
               to do any act, his decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When
               any appeal is from a decision of the building code administrator requiring the person
               aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement
               until the hearing of the housing appeals board unless the building code administrator
               certifies to the housing appeals board, after the notice of appeal is filed with him,
               that, because of facts stated in the certificate (a copy of which shall be furnished
               the appellant), a suspension of his requirement would cause imminent peril to life
               or property. In that case, the requirement shall not be suspended except by a restraining
               order, which may be granted for due cause shown upon not less than one day's written
               notice to the building code administrator, by the housing appeals board, or by a court
               of record upon petition made pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.
