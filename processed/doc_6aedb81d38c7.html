               reported to the director of solid waste who shall thereupon investigate the matter
               and attempt an informal resolution of such violation. If no solution is reached, the
               director of solid waste may cause notice to issue by personal service or registered
               or certified mail to the owner, occupier, tenant, lessee, or person in control of
               the property on which a violation exists. Such notice shall state the particulars
               of the violation, the date on which the violation was confirmed by the solid waste
               department, and shall state that such person has 15 days from receipt of the notice
               in which to remedy the violation. This section shall not prevent the director of solid
               waste from issuing a notice on discovery of a violation without having first had a
               report of a violation. After the expiration of the 15-day period, if the violation
               has not been corrected, the director of solid waste may cause a criminal summons to
               issue. The owner, occupier, tenant, lessee, or person in control of the property on
               which the violation exists shall be guilty of a Class 3 misdemeanor punishable by
               a fine of up to $500.00 or a maximum 30 day's imprisonment as provided in G.S. 14-4.

               after the expiration of 15 days from receipt of notice, the director of solid waste
               may direct that the solid waste department correct the violation and may charge such
               person with the cost thereof. This section shall not prevent prosecution of such person
               for a misdemeanor as in subsection (a) of this section, but shall be in addition thereto.
