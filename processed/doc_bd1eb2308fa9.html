               In order to maintain adequate solid waste disposal it is desirable to require review
               of solid waste disposal facilities proposed in the county. The review will require
               adherence to the latest edition of the rules and regulations providing standards for
               solid waste disposal as prepared by the state board of health sanitary engineering
               division or other regulations adopted by the division. Proposed plans or proposals
               will be reviewed by the director of community development or his representative. The
               board of commissioners will then consider approval on submitted proposals at the meeting
               following the completion of review by the director of community development.
