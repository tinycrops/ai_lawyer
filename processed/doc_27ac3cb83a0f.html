            PREFACE
            </p><p class="p0">
            This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances
            of Buncombe County, North Carolina.
            </p><p class="p0">
            Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances and resolutions
            adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the
            history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note
            indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption
            of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code,
            the reader can locate any ordinance included herein.
            </p><p class="p0">
            The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and
            the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage.
            Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant
            state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting
            forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.
            </p><p class="bc0">
            <span class="ital">Chapter and Section Numbering System</span>
            </p><p class="p0">
            The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used
            in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts
            separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and
            the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter.
            Thus, the second section of<a href="" data-chunk-id="COOR_CH1GEPR" class="section-link" data-product-id="12776"> chapter 1</a> is numbered 1-2, and the first section of<a href="" data-chunk-id="COOR_CH6AN" class="section-link" data-product-id="12776"> chapter 6</a> is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the
            same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal
            system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that
            would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new
            section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in
            the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter
            embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of
            the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to
            the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved
            chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters
            is maintained when including new chapters.
            </p><p class="bc0">
            <span class="ital">Page Numbering System</span>
            </p><p class="p0">
            The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the
            left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume.
            The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion.
            In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates
            the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately
            to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical
            parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time,
            and their corresponding prefixes:

            The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been
            placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others
            in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government
            officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself
            which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user
            is interested.

            <span class="ital">Looseleaf Supplements</span>
            </p><p class="p0">
            A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental
            servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date.
            Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or
            pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies
            of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and
            deleting the obsolete pages.
            </p><p class="p0">
            Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder
            of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility
            of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions.
            It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately
            upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be
            saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

            This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor,
            and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.
            Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their
            sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.
            </p><p class="p0">
            The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Kathy Hughes, Clerk to the Board of Commissioners,
            and Mr. Keith Snyder, Associate County Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance
            during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts
            and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the
            active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable
            tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.
