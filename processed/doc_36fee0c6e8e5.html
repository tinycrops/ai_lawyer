               125 feet from a single point or pedestal attachment to the customer's residence. Service
               in excess of 125 feet and concealed wiring shall be charged not to exceed additional
               installation costs before installation begins. The desire of the subscriber as to
               the point of entry into the residence shall be observed whenever possible. Runs in
               building interiors shall be as unobtrusive as possible. The grantee shall use due
               care in the process of installation and shall repair any damage to the subscriber's
               property caused by such installation. Such restoration shall be undertaken within
