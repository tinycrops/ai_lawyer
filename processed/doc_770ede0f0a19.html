               Construction and repair work arising from situations involving public health and safety
               is exempt from competitive bidding requirements. Use of this exception should be limited
               to situations involving an imminent or immediate threat to public health and safety.
               The exception is not allowed if the local government can complete with competitive
               bidding requirements without exacerbating the threat to public health and safety or
               damage to property (G.S. 143-129(e)(2).
