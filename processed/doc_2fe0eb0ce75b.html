               All wastewater spills that reach the surface waters (regardless of volume) and all
               spills to the ground surface exceeding 1,000 gallons (regardless of whether they are
               contained or reach surface waters) should be reported by the discharger to the state's

               Whenever a discharge of untreated wastewater of 1,000 gallons or more reaches surface
               waters, a press release must be sent by the discharger to all print and electronic
               news media providing general coverage in the county where the discharge occurred.
               The press release is to be issued within 48 hours of the determination that the wastewater
               has reached surface waters. A copy of the press release and a list of the media to
               which it was distributed must be kept on file by the user for at least one year and
               copies made available upon request.

               If the untreated discharge to the surface waters is 15,000 gallons or more, the discharger
               must issue a press release and a notice of the discharge must be published in a newspaper
               with general circulation in the county where the discharge occurred and in each county
               downstream that is significantly affected. The Secretary of the Department of Environment
               and Natural Resources determines which counties are significantly affected, and publication
               must occur within ten days of this determination and DENR's approval of the form and
               content of the notice and the newspapers in which it is to be published.
