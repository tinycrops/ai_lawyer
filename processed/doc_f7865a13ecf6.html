               franchise, and FCC technical standards, which standards are incorporated by reference

               are free from any significant distortion and interference. The system shall be designed,
               constructed, operated and maintained for 24-hours-a-day continuous operation. The
               system shall produce, for reception on subscribers' receivers which are in good working
               order, either monochrome or color pictures (providing the receiver is color capable)

               systems of similar size in the State of North Carolina. Provided, however, that any
               improvement needed to meet such level can be instituted through technology which has
               been demonstrated to be feasible for its intended purpose, in an operationally workable
               manner, and in an economically viable manner.
