               After the manufactured home park application is approved, the planning department
               shall issue a manufactured home park construction permit. The intent of this permit
               is to enable the execution of the park plan in the field and shall not be construed
               to entitle the recipient to offer spaces for rent or lease or to operate a manufactured
               home park as defined in this article.

               When the construction of the manufactured home park is completed, the developer shall
               apply to the planning department for a manufactured home park operating permit. If
               the manufactured home park conforms to the park plan approved by the administrator
               and other agencies, the planning department shall issue the developer a manufactured
               home park operating permit. If the park does not conform to the approved plan, the
               planning department shall delay issuance of the manufactured home park operating permit
               until it comes into conformity. The manufactured home park operating permit issued
               to the developer shall constitute authority to lease or rent spaces in the manufactured
               home park.
