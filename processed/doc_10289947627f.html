               <span class="ital">General.</span> The county can lease conservation easements in agricultural lands. Applications will
               be ranked based upon various site factors. Conservation easements will be leased in
               accordance with the ranking of farm properties and the availability of allocated funds.
               Compensation for conservation easements will be based on the advisory board's determination
               of cash rent values for comparable land. The lease price will be subject to negotiation.
               The leasing of conservation easements will be a low priority, used only when insufficient
               interest in the purchase of conservation easements exist.

               The advisory board will calculate a maximum cash rent value for each application.
               A cash rent value factor will be set by a committee consisting of the NRCS District
               conservationist, the county cooperative extension director, and three residents of
               the county selected by the advisory board, who derive a majority of their income from
               agricultural production. The advisory board will call the meeting of this committee
               and document the findings. The cash rent value factor will include the lease price
               per acre for the first five years of the lease and the formula for annual payments
               for the term of the lease.

               Upon calculating the lease value, the Soil and Water Conservation District attorney
               will present the value to the landowner by certified mail. The landowner will have
               30 days from receipt of the values to submit an offer to lease his/her conservation
               easements. Failure to respond in writing within the required time may constitute waiver
               of the opportunity. Upon receiving an offer to lease, the Soil and Water Conservation
               District attorney will meet with the landowner and accept, reject, or negotiate a
               compromise price with the landowner. If an agreement is reached, a contract to convey
               will be signed promptly by the landowner and the board of commissioners or their designee.
