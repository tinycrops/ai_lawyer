               Any act constituting a violation of the provisions of this article or a failure to
               comply with any of its requirements shall subject the offender to a civil penalty
               of $100.00 per violation. If the offender fails to pay this penalty within ten days
               after being cited for a violation, the penalty may be recovered by the county in a
               civil action in the nature of debt.

               This article may also be enforced by any appropriate equitable action. Such remedy
               may include a court order of abatement as part of a judgment in the case. The abatement
               order may include removal of violation and other actions required to make the property
               comply with the provisions of this article at the owner's expense.
