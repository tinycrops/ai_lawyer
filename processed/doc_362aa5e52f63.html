               The monthly 911 charge is an amount set from time to time for each exchange access
               facility subscribed to by a telephone subscriber whose exchange access lines are located
               in the area served by the 911 service. A schedule of fees is on file in the county
               offices. The amount of the charge may be adjusted at any time by the county board
               of commissioners to react to changes in operating costs for the 911 service.
