               Within 30 days after the final plat has been approved by the county planning board,
               it shall have been recorded with the register of deeds of the county. Should the 30-day
               time limit expire before the plat is recorded, it must be resubmitted to the chairperson
               of the planning board or his designee for reprocessing under the subdivision regulations
               then currently in effect. Upon adoption of these regulations, the register of deeds
               shall not thereafter file or record a plat of a subdivision located within the subdivision
               jurisdiction area of the county until said plat has been approved by the planning
               board. Without the approval of the planning board, the filing or recording of a subdivision
               plat shall be null and void. The clerk of superior court of the county shall not order
               or direct the recording of a plat where such recording would be in conflict with these
               regulations.
