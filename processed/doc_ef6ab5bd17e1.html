               The owner of any building or structure ordered by the building inspector to be demolished
               and removed, or who is directed by the building inspector to take any other steps
               to abate a nuisance or remove hazards found by the building inspector to exist, shall
               have the right of appeal from such orders to the board of commissioners for the county;
               provided, however, that such owner gives notice of appeal to the building inspector
               at the time of the hearing at which the order is made, or within ten days after such
               order is made, and files with the building inspector a written notice of such appeal.
               Notice of appeal shall state the grounds therefor. Unless an appeal is taken within
               the time and in the manner prescribed, the action of the building inspector shall
               be deemed final, subject only to such action as the board of commissioners may take
               as elsewhere provided in this article. Where an appeal has been properly taken and
               notice thereof given in accordance with the provisions of the section, it shall be
               the duty of the building inspector to report the same to the board of commissioners
               who shall cause the matter to be placed on the agenda for action by the board at its
               next ensuing regular meeting. The board of commissioners shall, in its discretion,
               have the right to continue the hearing of appeal from time to time.
