               The only home confinement that can be authorized by the director of animal services
               is when (i) the person bitten resides at the same residence; (ii) the owner has a
               fenced in area in his yard; (iii) the fenced in area has no entrances or exits that
               are not locked; and (iv) the animal is currently vaccinated against rabies. Proof
               of vaccination will be required at the time of investigation. If the animal is confined
               on the owner's premises, the animal services enforcement officer shall revisit the
               premises for inspection purposes at approximately the middle of the confinement period

               If rabies does not develop within ten calendar days after a dog or cat is quarantined
               under this section, the dog or cat may be released from quarantine upon written authorization

               veterinarian fees and a boarding fee set by and approved by the county board of commissioners.
