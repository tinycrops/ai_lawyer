               A certificate to operate as a first responder agency in the county, and issued by
               the county department of emergency medical services to an applicant agency will be
               permanent, with a minimum of four individual first responders. However, either party
               at its option may terminate the certificate upon 30 days' prior written notice to
               the other party or immediately upon failure to meet qualification standards.

               If any first responder agency or individual first responder shall violate or fail
               to comply with any provision of these guidelines, notification will be given by the
               director of the county emergency medical services to the first responder agency fire
               chief or his/her designee stating the violation and requesting a meeting to resolve
               the violation. If the violation is not resolved, the written complaint will be forwarded
               to the county first responder advisory board for its investigation of the complaint.
               The first responder advisory board will have the final authority on suspension or
               revocation of an individual first responder's certification. The board can make a
               recommendation to the board of county commissioners for suspension or revocation of
               a first responder agency's certificate.
