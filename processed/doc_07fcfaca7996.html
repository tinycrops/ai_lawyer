               officer shall make a final inspection. If he finds that the completed work complies
               with all applicable state and local laws, local ordinances and regulations and with
               the terms of the permit, he/she shall issue a certificate of occupancy. No new building

               may be occupied, and no existing building that has been altered or removed may be
               occupied until the public safety services department has issued a certificate of occupancy.

               be occupied before completion of the entire building. Violation of this subsection
