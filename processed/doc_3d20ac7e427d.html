               It shall be unlawful to display any animal in a public place for the purpose of selling
               or giving the animal away. This section does not apply to the display of animals by
               and within a pet shop, commercial kennel, or veterinarian's office. Only Buncombe
               County animal welfare organizations may display animals for adoption in a public place,
               provided that such organization is in possession of a permit issued at no charge by
               the sheriff or his designees. In such case any animal made available for adoption
               must be spayed or neutered, no less than two months of age, no less than two pounds,
               and if more than four months of age must be accompanied by a certificate verifying
               that the animal has been vaccinated to protect it from the rabies virus by a veterinarian
               licensed to practice in the State of North Carolina.
