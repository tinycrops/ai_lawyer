               commissioners. Completed applications shall be submitted to the sheriff's department
               at least 15 working days in advance of the planned use except in case of emergency.
               The applicant for a permit shall be responsible for sending a notice by certified
               and regular mail or by otherwise delivering the notice to the owners or occupants
               of each property within 500 feet of the parcel of real estate for which a permit has
               been applied. The notice shall state the type of event and date and hours of the event.
               The notice shall be sent on a form approved by the sheriff's office and shall be delivered
               at least 72 hours in advance of the event. The permit shall not be granted and issued
               until the applicant submits an affidavit satisfactory to the sheriff's office that
               such notices have actually been mailed or otherwise delivered. The applicant must
               attach to the affidavit a listing of the names of the owners or occupants and the
               street addresses of the properties notified pursuant to this section.

               is illegal by virtue of applicable state or federal law, he shall promptly submit
               a copy of the denied permit application together with a short statement of the reasons
               he believes he is entitled to a permit to the sheriff. The sheriff shall have the
               discretion to grant an exceptional permit waiving locational and time requirements,
               upon his determination that the applicant has made a substantial showing of legal
               entitlement.
