               In order to create staggered terms, the county board may designate terms of one, two,
               and three years for the members it appoints so that the terms of three appointed members
               shall expire each year. The procedure for determining the membership of the board

               into consideration diversity of opinion and the broadest possible representation.
               To that end, there should be representation from those governing bodies that provide
               financial support and there should be at large members from the various areas of the
               county, including the Morganton area, the Valdese area, and the rural areas of the
               county.
