               The flood prone areas within the jurisdiction of Buncombe County are subject to periodic
               inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption
               of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures of flood
               protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect
               the public health, safety and general welfare.

               These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
               causing increases in flood heights and velocities and by the occupancy in flood prone
               areas of uses vulnerable to floods or other hazards.
