               All permits issued under this chapter shall expire by limitation six months after
               the date of issuance if the work authorized by the permit has not been commenced.
               If, after commencement, the work is discontinued for a period of 12 months, the permit
               therefor shall immediately expire, unless renewed. No work authorized by any permit
               which has expired shall thereafter be performed until a new permit or renewal therefor
               has been secured.
