               Ordinance No. 97-1-10, adopted January 21, 1997, did not specifically amend the Code.
               Therefore, such ordinance was treated as deleting Â§Â§ 72-26â€”72-33 and adding new Â§Â§
               72-26â€”72-33, 72-36, 72-37, 72-46, 72-47, 72-56, 72-57. Such sections pertained to
               similar provisions and derived from Ord. No. 96-4-14, art. I, Â§Â§ Aâ€”C, art. IIâ€”VI,
               4-16-96; Ord. Nos. 96-9-7, 9-17-96.
               </p>

               Ord. No. 99-5-3, Â§ 1, adopted May 4, 1999, changed the name of art. II from "telecommunications
               towers" to "wireless communications facilities."
