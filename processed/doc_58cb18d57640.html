               If these provisions, or any request for information requires the production of proprietary
               information, the franchisee is required to produce the information. However, a franchisee
               may request that specific, identified portions of its response be treated as confidential
               and withheld from public disclosure. The franchisee must state the reasons why the
               information should be treated as proprietary and the facts that support those reasons.
               The request for confidentiality will be granted if the county determines that nondisclosure
               is consistent with the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. Section
               552, FCC rate regulations, and the state law, where applicable. If the franchisee
               requests confidentiality and the request is denied, (1) where the franchisee is proposing
               a rate increase, it may withdraw the proposal, in which case the allegedly proprietary
               information will be returned to it; or (2) the franchisee may seek review within five
               working days of the denial in any appropriate forum. Release of the information will
               be stayed until such time as disclosure is required by law.

               A request by any interested person or party for public disclosure and inspection of
               material withheld by the county as proprietary, shall be governed by the aforementioned
               federal and state law, where applicable. The county will notify the franchisee of
               the disposition of any request for public disclosure of information claimed by the
               franchisee, and withheld by the county, as proprietary information. The requesting
               party or the franchisee may seek review of any decision by the county regarding proprietary
               information, by filing an appeal with the appropriate form, as required by law. Disclosure
               of the information in question will be stayed pending resolution of any appeal.
