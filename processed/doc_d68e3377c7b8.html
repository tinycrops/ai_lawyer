               Whenever the agreement shall set forth any time for an act to be performed by or on
               behalf of the grantee, such time shall be deemed of the essence and any failure of
               the grantee to perform within the time allotted shall always be sufficient ground
               for the county to invoke an appropriate penalty including possible revocation of the
               franchise.
