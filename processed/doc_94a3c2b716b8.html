               Violation of this article may subject the violator to criminal as well as civil action.
               In addition to the civil penalties or fees imposed under this article, violation of
               this article shall be a misdemeanor for which a criminal summons or warrant may be
               issued. A violation of this chapter shall constitute a Class 3 misdemeanor as set
               forth in G.S. 14-4. The maximum fine for a violation under this chapter is $500.00
               or a maximum 30 day's imprisonment. Each day's violation of this section is a separate
               offense. Payment of a fine imposed in criminal proceedings pursuant to this section
               does not relieve the violator of his liability for taxes, civil penalties or fees
               imposed under this article.
