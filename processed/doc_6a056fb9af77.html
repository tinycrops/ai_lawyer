               Except as provided in this section, it shall be unlawful for any person owning or
               keeping a dog to leave a dog restrained to a stationary object for a period of time
               or under conditions that are harmful or potentially harmful to the animal.
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0">
               At no time may a dog remain on an uninhabited property such as a vacant lot or a lot
               without an occupied domicile.
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0">
               Any dog less than four months old shall not be tethered.
               
            </p>

               Under no circumstances shall an unaltered female dog be tethered without direct supervision
               by the owner or attendant or must be secured in a secondary enclosure.
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0">
               Only one dog shall be attached to a tether at one time.
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0">
               The minimum length of the tether shall be ten feet.
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0">
               The tether line shall weigh no more than five percent of the dog's body weight and
               be made of a substance which cannot be damaged by the dog.
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0">
               The tether must be attached to the dog with an appropriate harness or buckle-style
               collar properly fitted with room enough for two fingers to fit between the collar
               and the dog.
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0">
               The use of pinch, weighted, or choke collars is prohibited when tethered.
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0">
               Tethering shall be used for no longer than 14 consecutive hours within a 24-hour period
               after such time the dog must be released from the restraint to engage in supervised
               exercise and socialization.
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0">
               The restraint system shall maintain the dog's freedom of movement and freedom from
               entanglement, and it shall allow access to food, water, shelter, and shade.
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0">
               The restraint system shall be affixed to a stationary object which does not permit
               the dog to travel within five feet of any property line and housed or restrained no
               closer than 15 feet from a public street, road, sidewalk, or right-of-way, such circumstances
               constitute a public nuisance. If the animal is on the street, road, sidewalk, or right-of-way,
               the animal services enforcement officer shall issue a notice to the owner directing
               the owner to move the animal. If the animal is found on a public street, road, sidewalk,
               or right-of-way and the owner is not at home or refuses to remove the animal from
               the street, road, sidewalk, or right-of-way, the animal may be seized and impounded.
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0">
               If tethered to a pulley or zip line, the stationary cable that the pulley runs on
               must be at least ten feet in length, anchored on each end to a stationary object which
               cannot be moved by the dog, and include stops on each end to prevent the animal from
               becoming wrapped around the stationary object.
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0">
               The restraint system shall be situated at least five feet away from any fence to prevent
               strangulation.
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0">
               The line attached to the restraint system must allow the dog to move perpendicularly
               at least ten feet from the stationary cable.
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0">
               A swivel of proper size and durability shall connect the tether to the pulley or zip
               line to prevent entanglement.
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0">
               The clamps attaching the tether to the dog's harness must be of proper size and durability.
               
            </p>
            <p class="p0">
               In cases where deemed necessary for public safety, written exemptions may be made
               by the animal services director's discretion for other restraint methods but only
               after opportunities to verify those methods are needed and that they serve the purpose
               and intent of this section.
