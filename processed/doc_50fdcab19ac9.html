               The county emergency medical service has transport vehicles certified by the state
               office of emergency medical services (OEMS), which are manned by personnel trained
               and certified as paramedics (EMT-P). The service has six stations which serve the
               county. The primary goal of an emergency medical service system is to reduce the probability
               of death of a victim by providing trained, well-equipped personnel at the scene of
               an accident or illness in a prompt, efficient, and coordinated manner. It is most
               desirable to have medically trained personnel located in close proximity to the citizens
               so that life sustaining measures may be given in the first few minutes after the occurrence
               of an accident or illness. A first responder program is a logical and economically
               feasible way to ensure that prehospital care is available to the rural citizens in
               the first minutes when life or death may be decided.
