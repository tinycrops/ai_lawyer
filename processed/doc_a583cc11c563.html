               The county shall adopt, at least annually, an adequate schedule of user charges and
               surcharges and tap fees to defray the cost of administering, operating and maintaining
               the sewerage system. The costs to be used as a basis for determining the charges shall
               include, but are not necessarily limited to, administration, direct operation and
               maintenance, collection and billing of charges, bond redemption, studies and reports,
               professional fees, repairs, capital improvements and cost of service line connections.
               The user charges, surcharges and tap fees are to be used only for the purpose of administering,

               surcharge shall be imposed in addition to any other charges made for sewer service
