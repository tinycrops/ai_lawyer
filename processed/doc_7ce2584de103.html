               The county may require a person who engaged in a land-disturbing activity and failed
               to retain sediment generated by the activity, as required by G.S. 113A-57(3), to restore
               the waters and land affected by the failure so as to minimize the detrimental effects
               of the resulting pollution by sedimentation. This authority is in addition to any
               other civil or criminal penalty or injunctive relief authorized under this chapter.
