               If any occupant fails to comply with an order to vacate a dwelling, the public officer

               to vacate the dwelling shall be in the nature of summary ejectment and shall be commenced
               by filing a complaint naming as parties-defendant any person occupying such dwelling.
               The clerk of superior court shall issue a summons requiring the defendant to appear
               before a magistrate at a certain time, date and place not to exceed ten days from
               the issuance of the summons to answer the complaint. The summons and complaint shall
               be served as provided in G.S. 42-29. The summons shall be returned according to its
               tenor, and if on its return it appears to have been duly served, and if at the hearing
               the public officer produces a certified copy of an ordinance adopted by the board
               of commissioners authorizing the officer to proceed to vacate the occupied dwelling,
               the magistrate shall enter judgment ordering that the premises be vacated and that
               all persons be removed. The judgment ordering that the dwelling be vacated shall be
               enforced in the same manner as the judgment for summary ejectment entered under G.S.
               42-30. An appeal from any judgment entered hereunder by the magistrate may be taken
               as provided in G.S. 7A-228, and the execution of such judgment may be stayed as provided
               in G.S. 7A-227. An action to remove an occupant of a dwelling who is a tenant of the
               owner may not be in the nature of a summary ejectment proceeding pursuant to this
               subsection unless such occupant was served with notice at least 30 days before the
               filing of the summary ejectment proceeding that the board of commissioners has ordered
               the public officer to proceed to exercise his duties under this section to vacate
               and close or remove and demolish the dwelling.

               request for such notices. A minimum period of 45 days from the mailing of such notice

               the opportunity for any organization to negotiate with the owner to make repairs,
               lease, or purchase the property for the purpose of providing affordable housing. The
