               153A-123(d) and (e), the provisions of this division may be enforced by a franchised
               collector or the board of commissioners in the following manner: A franchised collector,
               or the board of commissioners may, after notice to any person or business in violation
               of this division, apply to the superior court for injunctive relief to restrain such
               person or business from continuing the violation. If, upon application, it shall appear
               to the court that such person or business has violated, or is violating, the provisions
               of this division, the court may issue appropriate orders and/or injunctions restraining
               any further violations. Such injunctive relief may be granted regardless of whether
               criminal prosecution has been or may be instituted under any other provisions of this
               division.
