               Violation of this article shall, in addition to the criminal penalties imposed by
               any conviction of a misdemeanor, subject the offender to a civil penalty, not to exceed
               the sum of $5,000.00, to be recovered by the county in a civil action in the nature
               of debt if the offender does not pay the penalty within a period of 30 days after
               he has been cited for violation of this article. This article may be enforced by an
               appropriate equitable remedy issued from a court of competent jurisdiction. It shall
               not constitute a defense to the county's application for equitable relief that there
               is an adequate remedy at law.
