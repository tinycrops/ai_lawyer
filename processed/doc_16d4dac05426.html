               The county shall have a five percent goal for participation by minority businesses
               in the total value of work for each project for which contracts are awarded pursuant
               to G.S. 143-128. To assist in meeting this goal, the county will use its best efforts
               to advertise contracting opportunities, to include minority firms on any bidding list
               which may be prepared by the county, and to explain to minority businesses the bidding
               procedures. The minority bidding list of the state, county, and other entities in
               the Unifour Area shall be referred to from time to time so that minority businesses
               doing business in this area can be contacted with respect to projects and bidding
               by the county. The county manager, or his designee, is designated as the person to
               monitor and to keep records of business minority participation in the bidding process
               and in the actual construction process based upon total dollars involved in the construction
               project. The county manager shall cause the same to be presented, along with the annual
               audit of the budget, and a report of the percentage (based on dollar amounts) of the
               construction projects of the county actually done by minority businesses.
