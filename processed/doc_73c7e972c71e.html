               facility under this article for a reasonable amount of time to inquire about that
               person's status as a registered sex offender if the officer reasonably believes, or
               has probable cause to believe, that the person is a registered sex offender who is
               in violation of this article or has committed a crime for which the person, if convicted,
               could be required to register as a sex offender. Nothing in this section shall limit
               a law enforcement officer from running any background check that is currently permissible
               under the law.
