               The possession or use of pyrotechnics (fireworks) is prohibited except for pyrotechnics
               exhibited, used, or discharged in connection with an authorized public exhibition
               and approved by the county fire marshal, and parks and recreation director, or designee.
               Persons wishing to possess or use pyrotechnics in connection with a public exhibition,
               such as a public celebration, shall file an application for a special use permit with
               the appropriate park or county representative. All applicants shall enter an indemnification
               agreement with the county and obtain general liability and property damage insurance,
               with limits as determined by the county or its designee, which are reasonably necessary
               to cover possible liability for damage to property and bodily injury or damage to
               persons which may result from, or be caused by, the public exhibition of pyrotechnics
               or any acts or omissions on the part of the applicant or the applicant's agents, servants,
               employees, or subcontractors presenting the public exhibition. The county manager,
               fire marshal, parks director or designee may deny an application as deemed necessary
               to protect the public health, safety, and welfare, or to protect the natural resources
               of the park unit.
