               <span class="ital">Generally.</span> Every person owning or having possession, charge, care, custody or control of any
               dog shall keep such animal exclusively upon his premises. However, such dog may be
               off such premises if it is under the physical control of a competent person and restrained
               by a chain, leash, harness or other means of physical control. Service dogs trained
               to provide assistance to handicapped personas for sight, hearing, mobility, or other
               similar purposes do not have to be under physical restraint while off the owner's
               premises if the dog is under the handicapped person's direct control and is obedient
               to that person's commands. If the animal is found at large and has a micro-chip the
               owner will not be fined on the first offense and the officer will make reasonable
               effort to locate the owner. If a dog is found at large and taken to the shelter, the
               dog must be micro-chipped at the owner's expense before the dog can be returned to
               the owner.

               be excluded from the provisions requiring physical restraint while the dogs are engaged
               in performance provided that the performance complies with state law and provided
               that the performers are not trespassing.
