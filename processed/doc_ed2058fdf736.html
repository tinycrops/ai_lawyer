               Whenever a violation of articles I through VI of this chapter occurs, or is alleged
               to have occurred, any person may file a written complaint, signed, dated, and addressed
               for public record before such alleged violation is investigated. Such complaint stating
               fully the causes and basis thereof shall be filed with the code enforcement supervisor.
               The code enforcement supervisor shall record such complaint, immediately investigate,
               and take action thereon as provided by articles I through VI of this chapter. It is
               the intent of this section to allow the county to use the means necessary to remedy
               each violation that attempts to seek voluntary compliance initially followed by any
               other civil or criminal penalty allowed by law as deemed necessary to resolve the
               violation. Specifically, the provisions herein do not limit the county from using
               any method of enforcement whose authority is provided to the county by the General
               Statutes of North Carolina.
