               Whenever, upon the inspection of the facilities, equipment, or operating methods of
               any person holding a license to collect, transport, and dispose of solid waste, the
               solid waste director finds that the conditions or practices of such licensee are in
               violation of applicable state and/or local regulations or the solid waste collector
               agreement, the solid waste director shall give notice, by registered or certified
               letter addressed to such person, that unless such conditions or practices are corrected
               within ten (10) days of receipt of said letter, the license will be revoked. At the
               expiration of the ten-day period, the solid waste director shall perform a re-inspection,
               and if he finds that such conditions or practices have not been corrected, he shall
               give notice in writing to the license holder that the license has been revoked. Upon
               receipt of such notice or refusal of acceptance, no person whose license has been
               revoked shall thereafter collect or transport solid waste unless and until his license
               has been reinstated. No such license shall be reinstated by the solid waste director
               until he finds, upon inspection, that the conditions causing the violation have been
               corrected.
