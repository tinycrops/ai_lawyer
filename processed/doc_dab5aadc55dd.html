               The franchisee shall provide the county with certificates of insurance evidencing
               the above amounts. The liability certificates shall name Buncombe County as additional
               insured under the policies. Before commencing work, the franchise shall furnish the
               county with certificates of insurance on an approved form. The certificates shall
               provide that policies shall not be canceled or changed until 30 days' written notice
               has been given to the county. All insurance shall be procured from reputable insurers

               Providing and maintaining adequate insurance coverage is a material obligation of
               the franchisee and is of the essence of any franchise. The franchisee may meet its
               requirements of maintaining specified coverage and limits by demonstrating to the
               county that there is in force insurance with equivalent coverage and limits that will
               offer at least the same protection to the county. The contractor shall at all times
               comply with the terms of such insurance policies, and all requirements of the insurer
               under any such insurance policies, except as they may conflict with existing North
               Carolina laws or this article. The limits of coverage under each insurance policy
               maintained by the franchisee shall not be interpreted as limiting the contractor's
               liability and obligations under the contract.
