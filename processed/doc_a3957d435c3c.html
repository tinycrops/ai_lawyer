               <span class="ital">General.</span> The purchase of conservation easements is intended to create areas with sufficient
               amount of contiguous agricultural and/or open space land to facilitate the permanent
               agricultural and/or open space use of land. While program activity will be directed
               toward that goal, success is dependent on the voluntary participation of landowners.
               If a landowner or several owners of small tracts are the only participants in their
               area, the goal may not be achieved. These landowners could become land locked by development
               and agricultural and/or open space use may become impractical. In such a situation
               it may be in the best interest of the landowner and the public to allow repurchase
               of the conservation easements for the property in question. Other circumstances could
               also affect a property's suitability for continued agricultural and/or open space
               use. Repurchase of conservation easements by a landowner is foreseen as an unusual
               and infrequent occurrence, and would take place with the concurrence of the advisory
               board and the board of commissioners.

               met: The original purchase of conservation easements must have occurred at least 20
               years prior to the request for repurchase and the conservation easements must have
               been purchased by and not donated to the county.

               <span class="ital">Repurchase procedure.</span> A landowner requesting a review of his property for possible repurchase of conservation
               easements should do so by certified letter to the advisory board. The letter should
               state the reason for the request and the date that the property was entered into the
               program. Any repurchase agreement included in a perpetual conservation easement must
               comply with the North Carolina Conservation and Historic Preservation Agreements Act
               and applicable federal and state tax laws. Upon approval in principle to the repurchase,
               the landowner must submit two appraisals of value for the property in question. One
               appraisal will establish the fair market value of the property at its current highest
               and best use. The second appraisal will establish the value of the property for agricultural
               or open space use. Other appraisals may be secured as necessary. The advisory board,
               or its designee, will review the appraisal values and decide to either recommend a
               repurchase price to the board of commissioners or decline to recommend repurchase.
               If a repurchase price is approved by the board of commissioners, the landowner will
               be notified. If the price is acceptable to the landowner, he/she will submit a written
               offer to purchase the conservation easements. The county may accept the bid and advertise
               for upset bids. If an agreement is reached, a contract to convey will be signed promptly
               by the landowner and the board of commissioners or their designee. The landowner will
               secure all legal documents necessary for the closing and will bear all associated
               costs. When legal documents are prepared and adequate financing is available, a date,
               time, and location for closing will be agreed upon. Payment shall be made directly
               to the county at closing by a certified check or equivalent payment.
