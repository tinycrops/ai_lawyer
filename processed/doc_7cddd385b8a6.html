               permit when such suspension is necessary, in the opinion of the county, in order to
               stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present an imminent or
               substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment,
               causes interference to the POTW or causes the county to violate any condition of its
               NPDES permit. Any person notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service
               and/or the wastewater contribution permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the
               contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to comply voluntarily with the
               suspension order, the county shall take such steps as deemed necessary, including
               immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the
               POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The county shall reinstate the sewer
               connection upon proof of the elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed
               written statement submitted by the user describing the causes of the harmful contribution
               and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the
               county within 15 days of the date of occurrence.
