               At the time of request for water and/or sewer service, each customer not owning property
               to which such service is to be provided shall make a deposit in the amount established
               by the board of commissioners from time to time. In the case of a customer making
               a deposit with respect to only one service, no additional deposit shall be required
               upon subsequent request for the second service.

               The deposit shall be retained by the county during such time as service is continued
               and may be applied to payment of future charges; provided, however, that such application
               to payment shall have no effect upon the operation of the provisions of this division
               relating to nonpayment. If such application to payment is made, there shall thereupon
               be due and payable an amount sufficient to restore the funds on deposit to equal the
               original amount of such deposit. Any funds remaining upon termination of service to
               such customer shall be returned to him.
