               In the adoption of this article, the commissioners find the following statements of
               intent:

                  Large-scale development projects often occur in multiple phases extending over a period
                  of years, requiring a long-term commitment of both public and private resources.
                  
               </p>

               </p>
               		
               <p class="content2">
                  Such large-scale developments often create potential community impacts and potential
                  opportunities that are difficult or impossible to accommodate within traditional zoning
                  processes.

               <p class="content2">
                  Because of their scale and duration, such large-scale projects often require careful
                  integration between public capital facilities planning, financing, and construction
                  schedules and the phasing of the private development.

               <p class="content2">
                  Because of their scale and duration, such large-scale projects involve substantial
                  commitments of private capital by private developers, which private developers are
                  unwilling to risk without sufficient assurances that development standards will remain
                  stable through the extended period of the development.
                  
               </p>

               <p class="content2">
                  Because of their size and duration, such developments often permit communities and
                  developers to experiment with different or nontraditional types of development concepts
                  and standards, while still managing the impacts on the surrounding areas.

                  To better structure and manage development approvals for such large-scale developments
                  and ensure their proper integration into local capital facilities programs, local
                  governments need the flexibility in negotiating such developments.

                  In negotiating for such developments, it is the intent of the county to remain consistent
                  with the adopted plans, policies, and goals of the county as they relate to land use
                  and capital improvements.
