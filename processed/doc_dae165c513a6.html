               <span class="ital">District.</span> Conservation agreements for land within districts shall be enforced for a period
               of ten years unless revoked by the landowner or the county. A landowner may revoke
               a conservation agreement by providing 60 days' written notice to the advisory board.
               The advisory board may revoke a conservation agreement based on noncompliance by the
               landowner. A decision to revoke a conservation agreement by the advisory board shall
               be, subject to the appeal provisions contained in <a href="" data-chunk-id="COOR_CH4AGDI_ARTVAPAPAPPR_S4-82AP" class="section-link" data-product-id="13891">section 4-82</a>. Such revocation shall result in loss of qualifying farm status and loss of eligibility
               to participate in a district. Absent noncompliance by the landowner, neither the advisory
               board nor the board of commissioners shall revoke any conservation agreements prior
               to its expiration.

               <span class="ital">Enhanced district.</span> Conservation agreements for land within enhanced districts are irrevocable by a landowner
               for a period of ten years. Enforcement of the terms of the conservation agreement
               may be through an action for injunctive relief and/or damages in any court of competent
               jurisdiction. The county may also terminate benefits to the owner under this program,
               either permanently or during the period of violation, as appropriate. The advisory
               board may revoke a conservation agreement for land within an enhanced district based
               on noncompliance by the landowner. A decision to revoke a conservation agreement by
               the advisory board pursuant to this section shall be subject to the appeal provisions
               contained in <a href="" data-chunk-id="COOR_CH4AGDI_ARTVAPAPAPPR_S4-82AP" class="section-link" data-product-id="13891">section 4-82</a>. The right to terminate program benefits is in addition to any legal rights that
               the county may have under either this chapter or the terms of the applicable conservation
               agreement.
