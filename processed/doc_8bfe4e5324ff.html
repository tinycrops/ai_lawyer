               The governing body may, as part of a zoning ordinance enacted or amended pursuant
               to this division, designate (and from time to time amend) one or more historic districts
               within the area subject to the ordinance. Such ordinance may treat historic districts
               either as a separate use districts classification or as districts which overlap other
               zoning districts. Where historic districts are designated as separate use districts,
               the zoning ordinances may include among permitted uses those uses found by the resources
               commission to have existed during the period sought to be restored or preserved, or
               to be compatible with the authentic restoration or preservation of the district. No
               historic district shall be designated until:
