               <span class="ital">Wetlands</span> means "waters" as defined by G.S. 143-212(6) and are areas that are inundated or
               saturated by an accumulation of surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration
               sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence
               of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally
               include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. Wetlands classified as waters of
               the state are restricted to waters of the United States as defined by 33 CFR 328.3
               and 40 CFR 230.3.
