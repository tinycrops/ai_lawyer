               The board of commissioners may from time to time amend the terms of this chapter,
               but no amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been proposed by or shall
               have been submitted to the planning board for review and recommendation. The planning
               board shall have 30 working days from the time the proposed amendment is submitted
               to it within which to submit its recommendation to the county commissioners. If the
               planning board fails to submit a report within the specified time, it shall be deemed
               to have recommended approval of the amendment. No amendment shall be adopted by the
               board of commissioners until they have held a public hearing on the amendment. Notice
               of the hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county
               at least once a week for two successive calendar weeks prior to the hearing.
