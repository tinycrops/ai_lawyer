               Comprehensive emergency management plans shall be adopted and maintained by resolution
               of the county board of commissioners. In the preparations of these plans as it pertains
               to city and county organization, it is intended that the services, equipment and facilities
               and personnel of all existing departments and agencies shall be utilized to the fullest
               extent. When approved, it shall be the duty of all departments and agencies to perform
               the functions assigned by these plans and to maintain their portions of the plans
               in a current state of readiness at all times. These plans shall have the effect of
               law whenever a disaster has been declared.

               The director shall prescribe in the emergency plans those positions within the disaster
               organization, in addition to his own, for which lines of succession are necessary.
               In each instance, the responsible person will designate and keep on file with the
               director a current list of three persons as successors to his position. The list will
               be in order of succession and will nearly as possible designate persons best capable
               of carrying out all assigned duties and functions.

               the granting of authority for the persons so assigned to carry out such duties prior
               to, during, and after the occurrence of a disaster. Such services from persons outside
               of government may be accepted by local government on a volunteer basis. Such citizens
               shall be enrolled as emergency management volunteers.
