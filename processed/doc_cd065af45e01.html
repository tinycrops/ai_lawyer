               A permit to do any act allowed under this article shall authorize the act only when
               it is performed in strict accordance with the terms and conditions of the permit.
               Any violation by its holder or his agents or employees of any terms or conditions
               of a given permit shall constitute grounds for its revocation by the park or recreational
               area staff. If any permit is revoked, all moneys paid or on deposit shall be forfeited
               and retained, and the holder of such permit, together with the agents and employees
               who violated such terms and conditions, shall be jointly and severally liable to the
               county for any damages and loss suffered by it in excess of money so forfeited and
               retained. However, neither such forfeiture and retention by the county, of the whole
               or any part of such moneys, nor the recovery or the collection of such damages or
               both shall in any manner relieve such person from liability to punishment for any
               violation of any provision of any county park or recreational area regulation. All
               fees related to the use of county park or recreational areas are set forth in the
               fee schedule as adopted by the board of commissioners.
