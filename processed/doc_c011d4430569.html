               Nothing in this section shall be construed to make any county or its departments or
               agents responsible for the payment or collection of emergency medical services charges
               for services provided by any emergency medical service with its base of operation
               located in any county other than its own, except that a county requesting mutual aid
               in a disaster should make provision to reimburse the assisting county for expenses
               (limited to fuel, food and lodging) incurred as a result of the disaster response.
               Counties may elect to reimburse further expenses, to be judged on an individual basis.
