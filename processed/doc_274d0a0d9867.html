               All formal bids will be sent out by the purchasing manager as the authorized representative
               of the county. Bids will be opened and tabulated by the purchasing manager. When architects
               or engineers are employed to perform this service on construction bids, the purchasing
               manager should be present at openings when possible, receive copies of the public
               notice and bids, and prepare a recommendation for the award of a bid. Certain requirements
               must be followed in the formal bid process:

               <p class="content2">
                  Written specifications must be prepared. Efficient purchasing practices require buying
                  in accordance with carefully developed specifications. For purchases of standard items,
                  development of elaborate specifications are not necessary, but simple, standard specifications
                  are acceptable. Good, clear specifications are an essential aspect of competitive
                  bidding. Quality and service are as important as price; therefore, specifications
                  are needed that will fulfill but not exceed the requirements for which the items and/or
                  services are intended. Specifications are prepared by the purchasing office with input
                  from the ordering department to ensure that the products purchased fill the need.
                  A lengthy specification designed solely for the purpose of eliminating competition,
                  other than those able to supply a particular brand name, will not be permitted. Brand
                  names should be used only when no other product would be satisfactory.
