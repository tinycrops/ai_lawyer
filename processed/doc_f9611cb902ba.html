                  franchisee submitted a cost of service showing, the county may take an additional
                  period of time to make a final determination and toll the effective date of the proposed
                  rates for a commensurate period. The county may take an additional 90 days if it needs
                  more time to ensure that a rate is within the FCC's benchmark rate standards. The
                  county may take an additional 150 days to evaluate a cost-of-service showing. The
