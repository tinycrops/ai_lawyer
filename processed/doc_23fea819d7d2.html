                  Property owners who require Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) projects sooner than the
                  year in which they are funded by the County may seek County approval to advance the
                  project schedule at the property owners' expense through a negotiated contract. In
                  these instances, property owners shall be reimbursed, by negotiated contract, project
                  expenses using utility line-specific revenue from the project that was advanced.
