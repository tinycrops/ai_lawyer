               The final assessment resolution passed pursuant to this article may not differ in
               scope or reflect a cost increase from the preliminary assessment resolution. If, after
               the public hearing and other due consideration, the board determines a change should
               be made, there must be a new publication and hearing upon a new preliminary assessment
               resolution and assessment roll.

               If the board of commissioners decides a different percentage of the cost should be
               assessed than proposed in the preliminary assessment resolution or the project should
               be greater in scope than described in the original resolution, it shall adopt a new
               preliminary assessment resolution and advertise such resolution as provided in this
               article.
