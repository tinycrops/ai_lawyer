               Where the county's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants
               limited by federal pretreatment standards, the county may apply to the approval authority
               for modification of specific limits in the federal pretreatment standards. The term
               "consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the amount of a pollutant or alteration
               of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater treatment system to a less toxic
               or harmless state in the effluent which is achieved by the system in 95 percent of
               the samples taken when measured according to the procedures set forth in Section 403.7(c)(2)
               of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 403 (40 CFR 403.7(c)(2))â€”General
               Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution promulgated pursuant
               to the Act. The county may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the federal pretreatment
               standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval
               from the approval authority is obtained.
