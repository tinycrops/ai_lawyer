               The county has established a solid waste collection system consisting of centrally
               located bulk-storage container units. Such container units are alternately known as
               green boxes or by the trade name, dumpster. This system is intended for the collection
               of customary items of household solid waste and is serviced periodically by front-loading
               solid waste collection vehicles.
