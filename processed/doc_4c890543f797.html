               If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any word; the
               omission of any word necessary to express the intention of the provision affected;
               the use of a word to which no meaning can be attached; or the use of a word when another
               word was clearly intended to express such intent, such spelling shall be corrected
               and such word supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the manifest
               intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct words
               were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall be made or
               permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of such error.
