               On and after the date of adoption, these regulations shall govern each and every subdivision
               of land within the county and outside the jurisdiction of any incorporated municipality.
               However, this chapter may also regulate territory within the subdivision regulation
               jurisdiction of any municipality whose governing body by resolution requests such
               regulation; provided, however, that any such municipal governing body may, upon two
               years' written notice, withdrawal its approval of the county subdivision regulations,
               and those regulations shall have no further effect within the municipality's jurisdiction.
