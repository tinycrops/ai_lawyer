               The county finds that the development of cable television and communications systems
               has the potential of having great benefit and impact upon the people of the county.
               Because of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable television,
               the county further finds that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can
               best be served by establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the county
               or such persons as the county shall designate.

               Further, it is recognized that cable communications systems have the capacity to provide
               not only entertainment and information services to the county's residents, but can
               provide a variety of broadband, interactive communications services to institutions
               and individuals. Many of these services involve county agencies and other public institutions,
               by providing governmental, educational or health care communications.
