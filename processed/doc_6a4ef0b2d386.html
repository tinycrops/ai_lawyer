               Unless the development agreement specifically provides for the application of laws
               subsequently enacted by the county or municipality, the laws applicable to development
               of the property subject to a development agreement are those in force at the time
               of execution of the agreement, except as provided for in G.S. 153A-344.1(e). In the
               event state or federal law is changed, the development agreement is subject to the
               provisions of G.S. 153A-359.7(c).
