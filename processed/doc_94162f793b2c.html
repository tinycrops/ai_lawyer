               operations in accordance with a policy of totally open books and records. The county
               shall have the right, following reasonable notice, to inspect at any time during normal
               business hours, all books, records, maps, plans, income tax returns, financial statements,
               service complaint logs, compliance with performance test results and other like materials
               of the grantee which relate to the operation of the franchise and the chapter, to
               such extent as may be necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter, the franchise,
               or other pertinent provisions of federal law or regulation. Access to the aforementioned
               records shall not be denied by the grantee on the basis that said records contain
               "proprietary" information.

               of such maps or records is necessary or appropriate to the performance of any of their
               duties, then all travel and maintenance expenses necessarily incurred in making such
