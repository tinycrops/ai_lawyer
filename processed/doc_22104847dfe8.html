               In all cases referred to in this article which reach the board of commissioners for
               action, either upon appeal of the owner from the ruling of the building inspector
               or upon report of the building inspector that the owner fails or refuses to comply
               with his order or direction, the board shall hear the matter. If it finds and determines
               that the building or structure in question is in such a dilapidated or substandard
               state of disrepair as to constitute a fire or safety hazard, or to be dangerous to
               life, health or other property, or is a public nuisance, and that the owner of the
               building or structure has failed or refused, to take such other steps as may be necessary
               to abate the nuisance and to take such other steps as may be necessary to abate the
               nuisance and remove the hazards found to exist, it may cause the demolition and removal
               of such building or structure to be done, or effect such other remedies as may be
               necessary to abate the nuisance and remove the hazards, and specifically assess the
               cost of such work against the lot or parcel of land on which the building or structure
               was situated. Such assessment shall constitute a specific lien upon the lot or parcel
               of land on which the building or structure was situated, which may be enforced by
               an action instituted in the name of the county in the nature of an action to foreclose
               a mortgage, as provided by state law in the case of ad valorem taxes and local improvement
               assessments.
