               No person shall operate or maintain a firing range without a permit therefor. Permits
               shall be granted by the county manager or his designee to persons who, upon application
               therefor, agree to operate or maintain such firing range in compliance with this chapter.
               Any permit issued shall be valid for one year, at which time it may be renewed. The
               county manager is authorized to impose an appropriate application fee, and such other
               requirements for the granting of such permit as are not inconsistent with this article.
