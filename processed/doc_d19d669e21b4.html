               No person shall operate or maintain, permit or suffer the operation or maintenance
               of, or discharge a firearm upon a firing range within 450 yards of any residence or
               of any other occupied building; provided, however, that such range may be permitted
               if, and so long as, each and every resident or occupant of such residence and/or other
               occupied building shall give permission therefor. Such permission shall be given in
               writing, and a copy of such permission shall be presented to the county manager or
               his designee, who shall maintain such permission on file in his office. Permission
               shall not be deemed to have been given until such presentation is made to the county
               manager or his designee. Permission may be given by all or any one of such residents
               or occupants upon such terms and conditions, including, but not limited to, hours
               of operation, as may be determined or desired by them or any one of them. Any act
               done upon a firing range outside the scope of such term or condition of permission
               shall be deemed to be a violation of this chapter. Any such resident or occupant shall
               have, at any time after giving such permission, the continuing right from time to
               time to make any changes or modifications in the terms or conditions of such permission,
               including the right, at any time, to withdraw such permission. Any such change or
               modification or withdrawal shall be made in writing and shall be presented to the
               county manager or his designee. Notice of such change or modification or withdrawal
               shall thereupon be mailed by the county manager or his designee to the address given
               for such purpose upon the application for permits submitted with respect to such firing
               range. Such change or modification or withdrawal shall be effective after two business
               days after the date of such mailing, notwithstanding any lack, or alleged lack, of
               receipt of such notice.
