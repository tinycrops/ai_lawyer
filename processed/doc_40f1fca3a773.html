               county where public utilities providing either telephone and electric service are
               underground at the time of installation. In areas where either telephone or electric
               utility facilities are above ground at the time of installation, the grantee may install
               its service above ground; however, at such time as those facilities are required to
               be placed underground by the county or are placed underground, the grantee shall likewise
               place its services underground without additional cost to the county or to the individual
               subscribers so served with the county. Where not otherwise required to be placed underground
               by this article or the franchise, the grantee's system shall be located underground
               at the request of the adjacent property owner, provided that the excess cost over
               the aerial location shall be borne by the property owner making the request. All cable
               passing under the roadway shall be installed in conduit.
