               <span class="ital">Baseline documentation purpose</span>. This policy establishes the procedure for the collection, compilation, and storage
               of baseline documentation for conservation easements managed by Buncombe County Soil
               and Water Conservation District. The Soil and Water Conservation District must have
               baseline documentation for all properties it protects. This information establishes
               the condition of a property at the time of acquisition, allowing comparisons with
               findings during subsequent monitoring events. Such information is also required by
               the IRS for landowners seeking a federal income tax deduction for conservation easement
               donations. In most cases, the Soil and Water Conservation District will collect this
               information for the conservation easement donor. Baseline documentation is important
               in defending conservation properties from threats, including conservation easement
               violations. The baseline documentation may be relied upon during litigation to establish
               the condition of a property prior to a conservation easement violation. The Soil and
               Water Conservation District will collect and store all baseline documentation for
               conservation easements in a manner that maximizes effectiveness for enforcement purposes.
