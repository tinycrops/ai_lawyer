               <span class="ital">Dangerous dog registration; permit required.</span> Any person who owns, harbors, possesses, or maintains any dog which has lawfully
               been declared to be dangerous pursuant to this article or G.S. 67-4.1 et seq. shall
               be required to obtain a permit from the department of animal control within 15 days
               of such declaration (or final appeal determination) at a cost of $200.00. An annual
               registration renewal fee of $25.00 must also be paid by such person by the 10th day
               of July each year thereafter until such time as the dog in question expires, or ownership
               of such dog is relinquished to another person or to the animal shelter. Violation
               of this provision, including failure to pay registration and renewal fees, will result
               in immediate seizure of such animal by the department of animal control, and immediate
               termination of ownership rights to such animal. The determination of the animal's
               final disposition will be at the discretion of the sheriff, his designee or shelter
               manager.
