                  Burke County has established agricultural districts to protect and preserve agricultural
                  lands and activities. These districts have been developed and mapped by the county
                  to inform all purchasers of real property that certain agricultural and forestry activities,
                  including but not limited to pesticide spraying, manure spreading, machinery and truck
                  operation, livestock operations, sawing, and other common farming activities may occur
                  in these districts any time during the day or night. Maps and information on the location
                  and establishment of these districts can be obtained from the North Carolina Cooperative
                  Extension Service office, the office of the Register of Deeds, the Community Development
                  Department, or the Natural Resources Conservation Service office.
