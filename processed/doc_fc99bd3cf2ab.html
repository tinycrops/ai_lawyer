               Pursuant to G.S. 153A-123, the county manager, in consultation with county legal services,
               may choose from the remedies set forth below to enforce the requirements of this Chapter
               when there is a failure to comply with the requirements of this article. Those remedies
               are as follows:
               
               <p class="incr1">
                  (1)
                  </p>
               		
               <p class="content2">
                  In addition to or in lieu of the other remedies set forth in this article the county
                  manager, or their designee, may issue a citation setting forth a civil penalty of
                  $100.00. In the case of a continuing violation, each 24-hour period in which the violation
                  continues to exist shall constitute a separate violation. The citation shall be served
                  upon the person violating any of the requirements of this section by hand delivery
                  or certified mail or by any other means made in accordance with the North Carolina
                  rules of civil procedure. In the event the violator does not pay the penalty within
                  30 days of service of the citation, the civil penalty shall be collected by the county
                  in a civil action in the nature of debt, which shall not subject the offender to the
                  penalty provisions of G.S. 14-4.
