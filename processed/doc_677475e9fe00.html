               The county may take such action as it deems appropriate through the advisory board
               or other entities or individuals to encourage the formation of the districts and to
               further their purposes and objectives, including the implementation of a public information
               program to reasonably inform landowners of the agricultural district program. The
               county may contract with the North Carolina Cooperative Extension to serve as the
               educational advisor and organization charged with delivering this educational program.
