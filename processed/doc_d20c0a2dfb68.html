               <span class="ital">Generally.</span> Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials
               or other substances regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge
               of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user's own
               cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide
               this protection shall be submitted to the county for review and shall be approved
               by the county before construction of the facility. All existing users shall complete
               such a plan by June 30, 1988. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after
               the effective date of the ordinance from which this article is derived shall be permitted
               to introduce pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have
               been approved by the county. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures
               shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's
               facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this article. In the case of an
               accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately telephone
               and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of discharge,
               type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.

               director a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures
               to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall
               not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be
               incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person
               or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties
               or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable law.

               shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge
