               An ordinance of May 2, 2000 has been treated by the editor as amending the Code by
               repealing former ch. 3.5, Â§Â§ 3.5-31â€”3.5-45, in its entirety, and adding a new ch.
               3.5, Â§Â§ 3.5-21â€”3.5-28, and 3.5-31â€”3.5-57, to read as herein set out. Former ch. 35
               pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from an ordinance of April 1, 1997,
               Â§Â§ Iâ€”XV.
