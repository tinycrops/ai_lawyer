               The county shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose
               of this article is being met and all requirements are being complied with. Persons
               or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the
               county or their representative ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of
               the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination or in the
               performance of any of their duties. The county approval authority and EPA shall have
               the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct
               sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user
               has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance
               before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with
               their security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel
               from the county, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay,
               for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities.
