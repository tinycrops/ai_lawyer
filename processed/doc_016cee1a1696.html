               At the public hearing held pursuant to this article, the board of commissioners shall
               hear all interested persons who appear with respect to any matter covered by the preliminary
               assessment resolution. At or after the hearing, the board may adopt a final assessment
               resolution directing that the project thereof be undertaken. The final assessment
               resolution shall describe the project in general terms, which may be by reference
               to projects described in the preliminary resolution, and shall set forth the following:

               The basis on which the special assessments will be made, together with a general description

               The percentage of costs to be assessed may not be different from the percentage proposed
               in the preliminary assessment resolution, nor may the project authorized be greater
               in scope than the project described in the resolution. If the board decides that a
               different percentage of the cost should be assessed than that proposed in the preliminary
               assessment resolution or that the project should be greater in scope than that described
               in that resolution, it shall adopt and advertise a new preliminary assessment resolution
               as provided in this section.
