               The intent of this chapter is to establish an agency that will ensure the complete
               and efficient utilization of all of the county's resources to combat emergencies as
               defined in this chapter.

               The emergency management agency will be the coordinating agency for all activity in
               connection with emergency management. It will be the instrument through which the
               board of commissioners may exercise its authority and discharge the responsibilities
               vested in it during an emergency.
