               When reports indicate a positive diagnosis of rabies, the county director of public
               health may order an area-wide quarantine for such period as he deems necessary. Upon
               invoking of such emergency quarantine, no dog, cat, or other carnivore shall be taken
               into the streets or permitted to be in the streets during such period. During such
               quarantine, no dog, cat, or other carnivore may be taken or shipped from the county
               without written permission of the animal control department and the police and sheriff's
               departments, and the police and sheriff's departments are hereby directed during such
               emergency, to impound any dog, cat, or other carnivore found running at large in the
               county. During the quarantine period, the animal control department or the local health
               authorities shall be empowered to provide for a program of mass immunization by the
               establishment of temporary emergency rabies vaccination facilities strategically located
               throughout the county.
