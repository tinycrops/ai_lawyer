               The flood hazard areas of the county are subject to periodic inundation which results
               in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
               governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and
               relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
               safety and general welfare.

               These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains
               causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard
               areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately
               elevated, floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
