               The agreement shall provide a description of all local development permits approved
               or needed to be approved for the development of the property, together with a statement
               indicating that the failure of the agreement to address a particular permit, condition,
               term, or restriction does not relieve the developer of the necessity of complying
               with the law governing their permitting requirements, conditions, terms, or restrictions.
