                  All communications by first responder will be on the ambulance frequency so that the
                  responding ambulance crew will receive all information without the need for an information
                  relay and all non-relevant communications will be kept off the fire frequency. These
                  communications should be limited to the first responder checking en route (10-17)
                  and arrival (10-23), plus any critical medical information.
