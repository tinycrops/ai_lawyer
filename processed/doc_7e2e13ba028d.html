               Comprehensive emergency management plans shall be adopted and maintained by resolution
               of the county board of commissioners. In the preparations of these plans, as it pertains
               to county organization, it is intended that the services equipment and facilities
               and personnel of all existing departments and agencies shall be utilized to the fullest
               extent. When approved, it shall be the duty of all departments and agencies to perform
               the functions assigned by these plans to maintain their portions of the plans in a
               current state of readiness at all times. The emergency operations plan for relief
               and assistance shall have the effect of law whenever an emergency has been declared.

               The coordinator, or his designee(s), shall prescribe in the emergency plans those
               positions within the organization, in addition to his own, for which lines of succession
               are necessary. In each instance, the responsible person will designate and keep on
               file with the coordinator a current list of three persons as successors to his position.
               The list will be in order of succession and will nearly as possible designate persons
               best capable of carrying out all assigned duties and functions.

               When a required competency or skill for an emergency function is not available within
               local government, the coordinator, or his designee(s) is authorized to seek assistance
               from persons outside of government. The assignment of duties, when of a supervisory
               nature, shall also grant authority for the persons so assigned to carry out such duties
               prior, during, and after the occurrence of an emergency. Such services from persons
               outside of government may be accepted by local government on a volunteer basis. Such
               citizens shall be enrolled as emergency management volunteers in cooperation with
               the heads of local government departments affected.
