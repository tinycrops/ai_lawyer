               shall at all times comply with all laws and regulations of the local, state and federal
               government. In the event that any actions of the state or federal government or any
               agency thereof, or any court of competent jurisdiction upon final adjudication, substantially
               reduce in any way the power or authority of the county under this chapter or the franchise,
               or if in compliance with any local, state, or federal law or regulation, the grantee
               finds conflict with the terms of this chapter, the franchise, or any law or regulation
               of the county, then as soon as possible following knowledge thereof, the grantee shall
               notify the county of the point of conflict believed to exist between such law or regulation
               and the laws or regulations of the county, this chapter and the franchise. The county,
               at its option, may notify the grantee that it wishes to negotiate those provisions
               which are affected in any way by such modification in regulations or statutory authority.
               Thereafter, the grantee shall negotiate in good faith with the county in the development
               of alternate provisions which shall fairly restore the county to the maximum level
               of authority and power permitted by law. The county shall have the right to modify
               any of the provisions to such reasonable extent as may be necessary to carry out the
               full intent and purpose of this chapter and franchise.

               any time be lawfully permissible, to regulate the cable television system, the franchise
               and the grantee. Should applicable legislative, judicial or regulatory authorities
               at any time permit regulation not presently permitted to the county, the county may
               following written notice to the grantee but without the approval of the grantee engage
               in any such additional regulation as may then be permissible, whether or not contemplated
               by this chapter or the franchise, including without limitation, regulation regarding
               franchise fees, taxes, programming, rates charged to subscribers and users, consumer
               protection, or any other similar or dissimilar matter.
