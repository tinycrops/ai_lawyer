               Pursuant to this article, no poles shall be erected by the grantee without prior approval
               of the county with regard to location, height, type and any other pertinent aspect.
               However, no location of any pole of the grantee shall be a vested right, and such
               poles shall be removed or modified by the grantee at its own expense whenever the
               county determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The grantee
               shall utilize existing poles and conduits, where possible. The county shall have the
               right, during the life of the franchise, to install and maintain, for a reasonable
               fee, upon the poles owned by the grantee, any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably
               interfere with the cable system operations of the grantee.
