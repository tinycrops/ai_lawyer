               by any person aggrieved thereby. Any appeal from the chief building inspector shall
               be taken within ten days from the rendering of the decision or service of the order,
               and shall be taken by filing with the chief building inspector and with the planning
               and zoning commission, serving as the zoning board of adjustment, a notice of appeal
               which shall specify the grounds upon which the appeal is based. Upon the filing of
               any notice of appeal, the chief building inspector shall forthwith transmit to the
               commission all the papers constituting the record upon which the decision appealed
               from was made. When the appeal is from a decision of the chief building inspector
               refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby to do any act, his decision shall remain
               in force until modified or reversed. When an appeal is from a decision of the chief
               building inspector requiring the person aggrieved to do any act, the appeal shall
               have the effect of suspending the requirement until the hearing by the commission,
               unless the chief building inspector certifies to the commission, after the notice
               of appeal is filed with him, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate,
               a copy of which shall be furnished the person who is appealing, a suspension of his
               requirement would cause imminent peril to life or property, in which case the requirement
               shall not be suspended except for due cause shown upon not less than one day's written
               notice to the chief building inspector, by the commission, or by a court of record
               upon petition made pursuant to G.S. 160D-1208(d) and subsection (e) of this section.
               The commission shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of all appeals, shall give
               due notice to all the parties, and shall render its decision within a reasonable time.
               Any party may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The commission may reverse
               or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision or order appealed from, and
               may make such decision and order as in its opinion ought to be made in the matter,
               and to that end it shall have all the powers of the chief building inspector, but
               the concurring vote of 80 percent of the members of the commission shall be necessary
               to reverse or modify any decision or order of the chief building inspector. The commission
               shall have power also in passing upon appeals, in the case where there are practical
               difficulties or unnecessary hardships in a way of carrying out the strict letter of
               the ordinance, to adapt the application of the ordinance to the necessities of the
               case to the end that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed, public safety
               and welfare secured and substantial justice done. Every decision of the commission
               shall be subject to review by proceedings in the nature of certiorari instituted within
               15 days of the decision of the commission, but not otherwise.
