                  It is the duty of each park owner to arrange for the provision of solid waste receptacles
                  of a type approved by the director of solid waste of the county. Each container shall
                  be constructed of a durable material in such a manner as to be strong, not easily
                  corrodible and shall have tight fitting covers. Containers shall be kept clean so
                  that no insect breeding, odor or other nuisance will exist. A sufficient number of
                  containers shall be provided to hold at least one week's accumulation of garbage.
                  All waste receptacles shall be emptied and such waste removed from the park property
                  at least once a week. The owner may remove such wastes himself or contract with a
                  collector serving the area.

                  Each park owner shall maintain the park property in a clean, sanitary and orderly
                  appearance and vegetation shall be neatly trimmed. The park owner shall not permit
                  the accumulation upon such property, except in approved receptacles, of garbage, refuse,
                  rubbish, litter, trash or other discarded materials, including used building materials,
                  batteries, scrapped appliances, rags, paper, rubber, dismantled or wrecked automobiles
                  or parts thereof, and other ferrous or nonferrous material. Safety hazards such as,
                  but not limited to, open wells, open manholes and abandoned appliances shall be promptly
                  corrected or removed.

                  with underskirting within 60 days of approval of electrical service. If the park owner
                  also owns the home, the underskirting shall be provided by the park owner. All skirting
                  shall be of a material and type manufactured for that purpose and shall be securely
                  attached. Skirting shall be sized from the ground to the lower perimeter of the structure
                  and shall be maintained free from broken sections or pieces. Masonry foundation shall
                  be approved as an alternative to this requirement.

                  hazards. Risers shall be reasonably uniform in height. Handrails, continuous on all
