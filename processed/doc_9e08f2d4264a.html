               activities of the federal and state governments. The county commissioners recognize
               the primary responsibility of the federal and state governments in this area. However,
               they also recognize that appropriations and manpower to fulfill this responsibility
               have often been inadequate, and that county responsibility is therefore necessary
               and lawful. The duties described herein shall begin upon receipt of a permit application.
