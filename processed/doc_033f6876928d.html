               Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the compliance date of such pretreatment
               standard, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into
               the POTW, shall submit to the director during the months of June and December, unless
               required more frequently in pretreatment standards or by the director, a report indicating
               the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such
               pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include a record of all daily
               flows which during the report period exceeded the average daily flow reported. At
               the discretion of the director and in consideration of such factors as local high
               or low flow rates, holidays budget cycles, etc., the director may agree to alter the
               months in which the above reports are to be submitted.

               The director may impose mass limitations on users which are using dilution to meet
               applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases where the imposition
               of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases, the report required by subsection
               (a) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment
               standards in the effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of
               sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration,
               or production and mass, where requested by the director, of pollutants contained therein
               which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. The frequency of monitoring
               shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment standard. All analysis shall be
               performed in accordance with procedures established by the administrator pursuant
               to Section 304(g) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR 136 and amendments thereto or
               with any other test procedures approved by the administrator. Sampling shall be performed
               in accordance with the techniques approved by the administrator. Where 40 CFR 136
               does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question,
               sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth
               in the EPA publication, "Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial
               Effluents for Priority Pollutants," April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any
               other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the administrator.
