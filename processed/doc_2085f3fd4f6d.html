               The purpose of this Article shall be to set forth the regulatory licensing requirements
               for adult establishments located within the county. Adult establishments, because
               of their very nature, are recognized as having serious objectionable operational characteristics.
               Studies and experiences have shown that lower property values and increased crime
               rates tend to accompany and are brought about by adult establishments. The board of
               commissioners finds that regulation of these uses is necessary to ensure that these
               adverse secondary effects do not contribute to the blighting of surrounding neighborhoods
               and to regulate acts, omissions or conditions detrimental to the health, safety or
               welfare and the peace and dignity of the county. Regulation to achieve these purposes
               can best be accomplished by the licensing procedure set forth hereinafter.

               The provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation
               or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented
               materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this article to restrict
               or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment,
               or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment
               to their intended market. This article represents a balancing of the legitimate ends
               of the community by imposing an incidental, content neutral place, time and manner
               regulation of sexually oriented businesses, without limiting alternative avenues of
               communication, and at the same time, requiring the business to carry its share of
               financing administrative and enforcement activities.
