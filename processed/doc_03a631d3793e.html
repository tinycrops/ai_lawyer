               Except for dangerous dog and potentially dangerous dog determinations made pursuit
               to G.S. 67-4.1 et seq. or as amended, any written determination made by the supervisor
               or officer within this article, the owner of the animal may appeal the determination
               by filing written objections with the sheriff within three business days of the violation.
               The owner shall be required to post a bond in the amount of the fine or penalty assessed
               with the application of appeal. Failure to post the bond will result in an invalid
               appeal. Upon timely receipt of an appeal and the posting of the bond, the sheriff
               or his/her designee shall render a decision within 30 days of the filing of the appeal.
               The decision of the sheriff or his/her designee shall be final. If the owner's appeal
               is successful, the county shall refund any fines or penalties paid by the owner regarding
               the matter that was appealed.

               Any appeal from the declaration that a dog is dangerous or potentially dangerous shall
               be made to the animal control appeals board. The owners shall have three business
               days from receipt of said declaration to appeal the decision. Said appeal shall be
               in writing and filed with the sheriff's department. Upon timely receipt of an appeal,
               the appeal board or its designee shall schedule a hearing before the appeals board
               within ten days of the filing of the appeal. If the owner's appeal is successful,
               the county shall refund any fines or penalties paid by the owner regarding the matter
               that was appealed. Any party has the right to have counsel present before the board,
               to examine and cross-examine witnesses and to have witnesses' testimony be sworn.
               The county attorney/designee shall preside over all hearings of the board, but shall
               not be a voting member. Any appeal from the final decision of the appeals board shall
               be taken to superior court of Buncombe County by filing notice of appeal and a petition
               for review within ten days of the final decision of the appellate board. Appeals from
               the rulings of the appeals board shall be heard de novo before a superior court judge.
               If there are any conflicts between this section and G.S. 67-4.1 et seq. or as amended,
               the provision of G.S. 67-4.1 shall prevail and apply.
