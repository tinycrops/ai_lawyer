               Every person, firm, or corporation licensed under this article shall, at the time
               of receiving the license, file with the city or county issuing the license a bond
               payable to such city or county in the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00), to
               be executed by the licensee, and by two (2) responsible sureties or a surety company
               licensed to do such business in this state, to be approved by the city or county,
               which shall be for the faithful performance of the requirements and obligations pertaining
               to the business so licensed. The city or county may sue for forfeiture of the bond
               upon a breach thereof. Any person who obtains a judgment against a pawnbroker and
               upon which judgment execution is returned unsatisfied may maintain an action in his
               own name upon the bond, to satisfy the judgment.
