               The establishment or maintenance of a manufactured home park in violation of this
               article shall be a misdemeanor subject to the penalties and enforcement provisions
               of G.S. 153A-123. Whenever the ordinance administrator determines that a mobile home
               park is being operated in violation of the ordinance, a notice will be issued to the
               owner and/or operator of the park which shall describe the violations with particularity.
               The owner and/or operator shall have 45 days from the issuance of the notice to correct
               the deficiencies before any legal proceedings are initiated, except that the notice
               period may be reduced to no less than five working days upon a finding by the ordinance
               administrator that the violations are of such serious nature as to constitute an immediate
               danger to health and safety. No legal action shall be initiated against the park owner,
               if the park owner files an action for summary ejectment against the owner of the manufactured
               home, which is the subject of the notice to correct deficiencies, within the 45-day
               notice period.
