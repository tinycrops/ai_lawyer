               The farmland preservation ranking system will be used to rank, or prioritize, applications
               received from landowners seeking sale, lease or donation of their conservation easements.
               The system can be used for evaluating conversion impact. Site and soil assessment
               criteria shall be maintained by the advisory board. The system consists of two parts:

                  for conservation. Each factor is assigned a point value based on its relative importance
                  to other factors.
