               If any wild or exotic animal shall attack, assault, wound, bite, or otherwise injure
               or kill a human being, the owner or keeper shall pay a fifteen hundred dollar ($1,500.00)
               civil penalty. If the animal services director, after investigation supported by the
               evidence, finds that a wild or exotic animal has attacked, assaulted, wounded, bitten,
               or otherwise injured or killed a human being, the animal services director will prepare
               a written order declaring that the animal is dangerous and prejudicial to the public
               safety or public health. When an animal is found to be dangerous or prejudicial to
               the public safety or public health, the animal services director shall have the authority
               to terminate the owner's ownership rights in the animal and to dispose of the animal
               in accordance with this chapter, or the animal services director may suspend the termination
               of ownership rights conditioned upon the owner's compliance with such terms as the
               animal services director deems necessary to ensure that the animal may be kept by
               the owner in safety. If such terms are part of a written order suspending seizure/forfeiture,
               the terms and the written order shall comply with the requirements of <a href="" data-chunk-id="COOR_CH3AN_ARTIIIDADOGUSEDOATTRFACOBRSACADO_S3-51DAANSEFOAPPR" class="section-link" data-product-id="12207">section 3-51</a>. The animal services director shall have the authority to modify the terms when it
               is necessary to ensure the safety of the public. The termination of ownership rights
               may be invoked upon the failure to comply with any of the terms. Written orders shall
               include the following statements:
