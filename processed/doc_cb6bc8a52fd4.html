               An appeal from any decision or order of the director may be taken by any person aggrieved
               thereby. Such appeal shall be taken within ten days from the service of the order
               and shall be taken by filing with the director and with the board a notice of appeal
               which shall specify the grounds upon which the appeals is based. Upon the filing of
               any notice of appeal, the director shall forthwith transmit to the board all papers
               constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was made. When an appeal
               is from the decision of the director refusing to allow the person aggrieved thereby
               to do any act, his decision shall remain in force until modified or reversed. When
               any appeal is from a decision of the director requiring the person aggrieved to do
               any act, the appeal shall have the effect of suspending the requirement until the
               hearing by he board, unless the director certifies to the board, after the notice
               of appeal is filed with him, that by reason of the facts stated in the certificate
               (a copy of which shall be furnished to the petitioner) a suspension of this requirement
               would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property or that because the
               violation charged is transitory in nature a stay would seriously interfere with enforcement
               of the ordinance. In that case proceedings shall not be stayed except by a restraining
               order, which may be granted by the appeals board or by a court of record on application,
               on notice to the officer from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause show. To this
               end the board shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.

               may appear in person or by agent or attorney. The board may reverse, affirm, in whole
