               The appropriate inspector may revoke and require the return of any permit by notifying
               the permit holder in writing stating the reason for such revocation. Permits shall
               be revoked for any material departure from the approved application, plans or specifications;
               for refusal or failure to comply with requirements of this chapter and the appropriate
               regulatory codes; or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing such
               permit. No permit fees will be refunded on a revoked permit. A permit mistakenly issued
               in violation of an applicable state or local law or ordinance or regulation may also
               be revoked.
