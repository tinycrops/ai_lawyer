               minimum standards of fitness for the initial and continued occupancy of all buildings
               used for human habitation, as expressly authorized by G.S. Â§ 160D-1205.

               that there exist in the jurisdiction of the county dwellings which, although not meeting
               the classification as unfit for human habitation, fail to fully comply with all the
               minimum standards for housing fitness as established herein and therefore have present
               one or more conditions which are inimical to the public health, safety and general
               welfare. Such conditions if not corrected can lead to deterioration and dilapidation
               of dwellings, which render them unfit for human habitation.
