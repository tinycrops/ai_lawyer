               Where, because of the size of the tract to be subdivided, its topography, the condition
               or nature of adjoining areas or the existence of other unusual physical conditions,
               strict compliance with the provisions of the chapter would cause an unusual and unnecessary
               hardship on the subdivider, the board of adjustment may vary the requirements set
               forth herein. In granting variances, the board of adjustment may require such conditions
               as will secure, insofar as practicable, the objectives of the requirement varied.
               Any variance authorized shall be entered in the minutes of the board of adjustment,
               together with the circumstances that justified the variance granted, and the conditions
               upon which the variance was granted. Submission of a variance application shall be
               accompanied by a filing fee set forth in the schedule of fees adopted by the board
               of commissioners.

               to review the board of adjustment's decision. The board of commissioners may uphold

               the variance application that it deems appropriate.
