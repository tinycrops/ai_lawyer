               A short brass corporation cock shall be installed at the water meter, and galvanized
               pipe, wrought iron pipe, or copper tubing used to the meter box. A brass cock and
               meter box shall be placed in the DOT right-of-way. The tap shall be made in the center
               of the upper quarter of the main nearest to the property to be connected, using not
               less than a five-eighths-inch corporation cock and gooseneck, and not less than three-quarter-inch
               galvanized wrought iron or copper tubing pipe and a three-quarter-inch cock at the
               curbline. The cock in the meter box shall be placed on the pipe just inside the meter
               box, then an elbow and meter connection with a union, then another elbow. The distance
               between the elbows shall be sufficient for proper settling of the meter.

               In all areas and locations where water pressure exceeds 100 pounds per square inch,
               the property owner shall provide such pressure-regulating valves as may be necessary
               to reduce the pressure in the piping system on his property to a safe level. It is
               recommended, but not required, that such pressure-regulating valves be installed where
               water pressures exceed 75 pounds per square inch.
