               Each commissioner shall serve a five-year term, with commissioners to serve overlapping
               terms so that one commissioner appointment is made each year. The Catawba County Board
               of Commissioners shall appoint two commissioners, and the boards of the other three
               counties shall appoint one each. These appointees shall serve their terms until September
