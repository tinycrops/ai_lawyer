               The availability of recreational opportunities for citizens of all ages is a subject
               of general interest and concern. The board of commissioners therefore declares that
               the public good and general welfare of the citizens of this county require adequate
               and safe parks and recreational areas. This article shall apply to parks and recreational
               areas owned or leased by the county or owned by other persons and available for use
               by the general public, if the private owners have requested and the board of commissioners
               has approved, by resolution, the applicability of this article.
