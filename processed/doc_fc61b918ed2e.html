               The purpose of this article is to promote agricultural values and the general welfare
               of Buncombe County, and more specifically: to increase identity and pride in the agricultural
               community and its way of life; to encourage the economic and financial health of agriculture,
               horticulture and forestry; and to increase protection from non-farm development and
               other negative impacts on properly managed farms.
