               Temporary wireless communications facilities may be permitted by administrative approval
               for a term not to exceed 30 days. Once granted, a temporary wireless communications
               facility permit may be extended for an additional 30 days upon evidence of need by
               the applicant. In case of emergency (e.g., storm damage to an existing tower or other
               circumstances resulting in the interruption of existing service) the administrative
               review shall be expedited to the extent feasible.
