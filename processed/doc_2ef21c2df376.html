               <span class="ital">General.</span> The county may purchase conservation easements in agricultural and/or open space
               lands. All applications for the purchase of conservation easements will be evaluated
               based upon the farmland preservation ranking system as described in<a href="" data-chunk-id="COOR_CH58PLDE_ARTIIIFAPRPR_DIV4AGCOEAPR_S58-79FAPRRASY" class="section-link" data-product-id="12776"> section 58-79</a>. Applications will be ranked based upon various site factors. Conservation easements
               may be purchased in accordance with the ranking of farm properties and the availability
               of allocated funds. Compensation for conservation easements will be based on the advisory
               board's determination of the difference between fair market value and agricultural
               or open space value appraisals. The purchase price will be subject to negotiation.

               and future owners to agricultural and/or open space use of the land. The conservation
               easements will be held in public trust by the county, or transferred to a private
               nonprofit conservation organization. Conservation easements will be in perpetuity
               and in compliance with the North Carolina Conservation and Historic Preservation Agreements
