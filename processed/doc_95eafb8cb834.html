               that treats, stores or disposes of hazardous waste or who fails to comply with any
               or all of the provisions of this article. The notice of violation shall contain a
               description of the violation, the date of inspection, a description of the action
               necessary for correction of the violation and the date that compliance is required.
               The notice shall also specify the amount of civil penalty to be imposed, if any, and
               when payment is due. The notice shall be hand delivered or mailed by certified or
               registered mail, return receipt requested, to the generator or owner, office manager,
               or registered agent of the facility. The county inspector shall sign a statement for
               his file of the date, time and manner of delivery. The failure to comply with the
               notice of violation by taking corrective action may result in revocation of the license
               or permit and/or any of the civil or criminal remedies set forth in this section.
