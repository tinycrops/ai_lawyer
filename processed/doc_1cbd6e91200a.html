               Comprehensive emergency management plans shall be adopted and maintained by resolution
               of the county board of commissioners. In the preparation of these plans as they pertain
               to county organization, it is intended that the services, equipment, facilities and
               personnel of all existing departments and agencies shall be utilized to the fullest
               extent. When approved, it shall be the duty of all municipal departments and agencies
               to perform the functions assigned by these plans and to maintain their portions of
               the plans in a current state of readiness at all times. The basic emergency operations
               plan and disaster operations plan shall have the effect of law whenever a disaster
               has been proclaimed.

               The director shall prescribe in the emergency plans those positions within the disaster
               organization, in addition to his own, for which lines of succession are necessary.
               In each instance, the responsible person will designate and keep on file with the
               director a current list of three (3) persons as successors to his position. The list
               will be in order of succession and will nearly as possible designate the persons best
               capable of carrying out all assigned duties and functions.

               be responsible for carrying out all duties and functions assigned therein. Duties
               will include the organization and training of assigned employees and, where needed,
               volunteers. Each chief shall formulate the operational plan for his service, which,
               when approved, shall be an annex to and a part of the basic plan.

               his recommendation for their approval. Such amendments shall take effect thirty (30)
               days from the date of approval.

               When a required competency or skill for a disaster function is not available within
               local government, the director is authorized to seek assistance from persons outside
               of government. The assignment of duties, when of a supervisory nature, shall also
               grant authority for the persons so assigned to carry out such duties prior, during,
               and after the occurrence of a disaster. Such services from persons outside of government
               may be accepted by local government on a volunteer basis. Such citizens shall be enrolled
               as emergency management volunteers in cooperation with the heads of local government
               departments affected.
