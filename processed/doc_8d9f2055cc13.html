               If the provisional permit or the permit to hold a mass gathering is revoked prior
               to or during the mass gathering, the county health director may order the permittee
               to install such facilities and make such arrangements as may be necessary to accommodate
               those persons who may nevertheless attend or be present at the mass gathering despite
               its cancellation and to restore the site to a safe and sanitary condition. If the
               permittee fails to comply with the order of the county health director, the county
               health director may immediately proceed to install such facilities and make such other
               arrangements and provisions for cleanup as may be minimally required in the interest
               of public health and safety, utilizing such county and local funds and resources as
               may be available to him. Prior to or within 60 days after such action, the county
               may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to order forfeiture of the permittee's
               performance bond or surety for violation of this article. The court may order that
               the proceeds shall be applied to the extent necessary to reimburse the county and
               other government agencies for expenditures made pursuant to the action taken by the
               county health director upon the permittee's failure to comply with his order. Any
               excess proceeds shall be returned to the insurer of the bond or to the surety after
               deducting court costs.
