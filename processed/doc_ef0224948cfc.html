               Approved rescue groups can pull animals from the county animal services center. Pursuant
               to G.S. 130A-192(a), all animals are required to be held for an initial impoundment
               period of 72 hours. However, in the event that an animal is surrendered to county
               animal services, the animal may be released immediately. Following the initial impoundment
               period, animals will be held in the animal services center and made available for
               rescue by an approved rescue group or adoption by the general public as long as the
               health and temperament of the animal determines that it is suitable for rescue or
               adoption. This determination will be made by the animal services director and the
               decision will be final.

                  Random audits will be performed by the animal advisory board to ensure proper care
                  and recordkeeping of all approved rescue groups. During each audit, two approved rescues
                  will be selected for audit review and required to provide all documentation to evaluate
                  the health and welfare of the animals as determined by the animal advisory board.

                  If the audit shows an approved rescue group is not in compliance two times in two
                  consecutive audits due to missing or incorrect documentation or refusal or failure
                  to provide documentation, a warning will be issued, and the rescue given ten working
                  days to produce additional documentation. If the rescue fails to produce requested
                  documents or additional information to refute the audit, the animal services director
                  may suspend the rescue's permission to pull animals from the animal services center.
                  Time of suspension will be no less than six months. Re-evaluation of the rescue will
                  be conducted by the animal services director. A second violation will warrant a 12-month
                  suspension, and any additional violations will mean permanent revocation.

                  In order to be considered for approval as an approved rescue group by county animal
                  services, groups must submit the county animal services' rescue application, along
                  with three letters of reference, one of which must be submitted by a state licensed
                  veterinarian with preference given to rescues that can also provide references from
                  other North Carolina-based animal shelters. County animal services will notify the
                  applicant group of its decision to approve or deny the application. If the application
                  is denied, county animal services will state any deficiencies that resulted in the
                  decision to deny approval of the application.
