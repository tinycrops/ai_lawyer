               Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be nonexclusive. The county specifically
               reserves the right to (i) grant at any time such additional franchises for a cable
               television system as it deems appropriate, and/or (ii) build, operate, and own such
               cable communication system or systems as it deems appropriate. Provided, however,
               no such franchise shall be granted on terms or conditions more favorable or less burdensome
               than those imposed upon any existing franchisee.
