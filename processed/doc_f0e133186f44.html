                  Ensure that before such hazardous waste and/or low-level radioactive waste is placed
                  into permanent or long-term storage, the best available technology is used in treating
                  such waste, including reuse, recycling, neutralization, detoxification, incineration
                  and maximum volume reduction. When these alternatives are not technologically feasible,
                  retrievable above-ground storage (or below-ground if such hazardous wastes and/or
                  low-level radioactive wastes are explosive or flammable) is preferable to other means
                  of disposal until appropriate methods of recycling or detoxification of the stored
                  hazardous wastes and/or low-level radioactive wastes are found, as directed by the
                  N.C. Waste Management Act, 1981 N.C. Sessions Laws, Chapter 704.
