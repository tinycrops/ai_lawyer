               disaster resulting from enemy actions or other disasters and administer the daily

               The county department of emergency management will be the coordinating agency for
               all activity in connection with emergency management. It will be the instrument through
               which the county board of commissioners may exercise the authority and discharge the
               responsibilities vested in them during disaster emergencies.
