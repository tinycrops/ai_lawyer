               On August 5, 1986, the board adopted Ordinance No. 18505, the county hazardous waste
               management ordinance. Pursuant to such ordinance, the hazardous waste advisory board,
               in cooperation with business, industry and other interested parties, instituted a
               one-year educational program on the management of hazardous waste, including among
               other things, the community coordinator program. One of the provisions of Ordinance
               No. 18505 was that the county board of commissioners would review the education program
               and determine if the public and affected parties had been adequately informed as to
               the details of hazardous waste management. The board hereby maintains its discretion
               to continue the educational program, if appropriate and necessary, for such additional
               period as this board desires.
