               Each license issued under this division may be renewed from calendar year to calendar
               year by submission of a renewal application to the sheriff at least 30 days prior
               to the expiration date of the license. After approval of such application by the sheriff,
               and upon payment to him of the annual fee, the sheriff shall issue to the applicant
               a renewal certificate which shall validate the applicant's license for an additional
               year.
