               Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, any animal impounded which is
               badly wounded or diseased, not a rabies suspect, and has no identification shall be
               destroyed immediately in a humane manner. If the animal has identification, the animal
               control department shall attempt to notify the owner before disposing of such animal,
               but if the owner cannot be reached readily, and the animal is suffering, the animal
               control department may destroy the animal at its discretion in a humane manner.
