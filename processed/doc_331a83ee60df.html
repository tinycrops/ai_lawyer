               director of parks and recreation on the form supplied by the parks and recreation
               department. If the director shall conclude that the issuance of a permit for the possession,
               consumption, display or sale of any alcoholic beverages, malt beverages or unfortified
               wine can be authorized for a specific time and area, will not hinder or impede any
               regularly established use of the county property and will not adversely affect the
               county's ability to care, protection or maintenance or create a nuisance on the property,
               the director of parks and recreation may grant permission for such use. If the director
               of parks and recreation shall determine otherwise, the application for a permit shall
               be denied; provided, however, that any permit granted shall be for use only in a clearly
               designated area and no alcoholic beverages, malt beverages or unfortified wine may
               be removed from that area into other areas or facilities. Further, individuals not
               designated in the permit application shall not be allowed in the designated area during
               the time set forth in the permit. In addition the applicant is required to get the
               necessary permits from the State of North Carolina. Alcoholic beverages, malt beverages
               or unfortified wine shall not be allowed in any boats or other rental or mechanical
               equipment.
