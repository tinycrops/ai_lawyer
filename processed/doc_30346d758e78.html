               Water shall be obtained from a public or community water supply approved by the sanitary
               engineering division, state board of health. If a new source of water supply is to
               be provided, the approval of the county health director must be secured prior to its
               use. If water is to be hauled from an off-site source, storage facilities shall be
               provided in the area sufficient in volume to supply the needs of the gathering for
               its duration. Before being filled with water for use during the gathering, all such
               storage tanks shall be cleaned thoroughly, filled with clean water containing a chlorine
               residual of at least 100 parts per million, and, after a contact time of at least
               24 hours, all such tanks shall be emptied. Subsequently, and prior to the issuance
               of a permit, all such tanks shall be closed and locked so as to give positive protection
               against the introduction of contamination.
