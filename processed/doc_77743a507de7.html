               A state of emergency may be declared by the board of commissioners if it finds that
               an emergency exists. Recognizing that circumstances and practical considerations may
               dictate a more opportune course, a state of emergency may be declared by the chairperson
               of the board of commissioners when he or she finds that an emergency exists. The declaration
               shall be in writing; shall activate any or all of the prohibitions and restrictions
               as authorized below and any and all applicable local plans, mutual assistance compacts,
               and agreements; and shall also authorize the furnishing of assistance thereunder.
               Reasonable steps shall be taken to give notice to the public of the terms of the declaration.
               Reports of the substance of the declaration shall be sent to the mass communications
               media which serve the affected area.
