               State fireworks laws permit the use of fireworks that do not contain more than four
               (4) grams of explosive and do not leave the ground (safe and sane fireworks). During
               times when weather conditions are dangerous to the point use of any fireworks may
               cause a fire, this section will apply so that any use of fireworks is prohibited if
               the fire marshal has issued a burning ban. In the event any permit has been obtained
               for a professional fireworks display, these types of displays will also be discontinued
               until conditions are favorable for a display. The fire marshal's office will notify
               permit holders in the event this occurs and a stop work order is being issued in accordance
               with G.S. Â§ 160A-421. A violation of this section is punishable as a misdemeanor.
