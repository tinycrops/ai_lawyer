               Any person who, being the owner or agent of any land located within the planning jurisdiction
               of the county, thereafter subdivides such land in violation of this chapter or transfers
               or sells land by reference to, exhibition of, or any other use of plat showing a subdivision
               and recorded in the office of the county register of deeds, shall be subject to a
               civil penalty in the amount of $100.00. The description by metes and bounds in the
               instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of selling or transferring
               land shall not exempt the transactions from this penalty. The county, through its
               attorney or other official designated by the board of commissioners, may enjoin illegal
               subdivision, transfer, or sale of land by action for injunction. Building permits
               required pursuant to G.S. 160D-1110 may be denied for lots that have been illegally
               subdivided. In addition to other remedies, a county may institute any appropriate
               action or proceedings to prevent the unlawful subdivision of land, to restrain, correct,
               or abate the violation, or to prevent any illegal act or conduct. Further, violators
               of this chapter shall be subject to the remedies as set forth in<a href="" data-chunk-id="COOR_CH1GEPR_S1-7GEPE" class="section-link" data-product-id="12776"> section 1-7</a>. The county may also assess a $100.00 per-day civil penalty for each day that the
               plat or property is not in compliance with this chapter. Each day that such plat or
               property is not in compliance with this chapter shall constitute a separate and distinct
               offense.

               Approval of an erosion control plan alone shall not constitute approval of a subdivision
               plan. Plan review fees shall be double the normal fee amount when land disturbing
               activity begins before preliminary approval of a subdivision is obtained from the
               county. Any land disturbing activity begun prior to preliminary approval of a subdivision
               shall be subject to a civil penalty of $100.00 per day. Each day the violation continues
               shall be considered a separate offense.
