               the outdoors for adequate ventilation. At least one window in every habitable room
               shall be of such size and location to allow egress by an average adult in the event
               of fire or other emergency. The minimum window area, measured between stops, shall
               be eight percent of the floor area of such room. Whenever the only window in a room
               is a skylight-type window in the top of such room, the total window area of such skylight
               shall equal 15 percent of the total floor area of such room. Exception: Less than
               eight percent of the total floor area is acceptable, provided there is mechanical
               ventilation.
