               The authority of the board of commissioners to finance the local share of the costs
               of improving subdivision and residential streets is discretionary. Before the county
               may finance improvements, it must receive a petition for the improvements, signed
               by at least 75 percent of the property owners representing 75 percent of the lineal
               front footage affected. There shall be a filing fee as set by the board of commissioners
               to cover the costs of advertising the required public hearings, certified mailings,
               photocopying and long distance telephone calls.
