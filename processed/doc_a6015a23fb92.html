               to transport 25 pounds of copper without a permit, or letter from the sheriff. The
               business or persons described in<a href="" data-chunk-id="PTIICOOR_CH26EN_ARTVRECESCYA_S26-136APAR" class="section-link" data-product-id="14529"> section 26-136</a> shall be required to request a copy of said permit should the copper transaction
               meet or exceed 25 pounds, and this business or person doing business shall retain
               a copy for both in-house records and provide a copy to law enforcement within jurisdiction.

               No transactions can be done to alter or circumvent this requirement as this will be
               deceptive practice and subject to violating the article. (Example: Making three different
               24-pound tickets to hide the fact that there was actually 72 pounds of copper.)

               If the seller does not have said permit then he should be referred to the sheriff
               of the county or obtain a permit before being allowed to sell possessed copper.

               If the seller does not have a proper permit to transport the material, the business
               shall refuse to accept possessed copper from the seller. If the business accepts the
               copper without the transportation permit provided by the seller, then the business
               is viewed as aiding in potential criminal conduct.
