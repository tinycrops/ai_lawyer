               or threatening to violate any ordinance, rule, regulation, or order adopted or issued
               by the county or any term, condition, or provision of an approved plan, it may, either
               before or after the institution of any other action or proceeding authorized by this
               chapter, institute a civil action in the name of the county for injunctive relief
               to restrain the violation or threatened violation. The action shall be brought in
               the superior court of the county in which the violation is occurring or is threatened.

               is occurring or is threatened, the court shall enter any order or judgment that is
               necessary to abate the violation, to ensure that restoration is performed, or to prevent
               the threatened violation. The institution of an action for injunctive relief under
               this section shall not relieve any party to the proceedings from any civil or criminal
               penalty prescribed for violations of this chapter. Upon determination by a court that
               an alleged violation is occurring or threatened, the county shall issue no building,
               zoning, or environmental permits to the violator until such violation is abated.
