               If the alarm administrator has reason to believe that an alarm system is not being
               used or maintained in a manner that ensures proper operation and suppresses false
               alarms, he/she may require a conference with an alarm user and may request the user
               to have the alarm business responsible for the repair of the alarm system present
               to review the circumstances of each false alarm.
