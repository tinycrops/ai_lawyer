               commission; nor to prohibit the animal control department or its agents or veterinarians
               from destroying dangerous, unwanted, or injured animals in a humane manner; nor to
               prohibit any individual from killing a dangerous animal in imminent defense of person
               or property; nor to prohibit the lawful use of animals in scientific research. A violation
               of this section is punishable as a misdemeanor.
