               By contract or by county personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and
               printed whenever authorized or directed by the board of commissioners. A supplement
               to the Code shall include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances
               passed by the board of commissioners during the period covered by the supplement and
               all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered
               that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, replace pages
               which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared
               that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the
               adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement.

               changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar
               as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code. For example, the codifier
