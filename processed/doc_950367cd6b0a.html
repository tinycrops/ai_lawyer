               order adopted or issued pursuant to this chapter, or who initiates or continues a
               land-disturbing activity for which a plan is required except in accordance with the
               terms, conditions, and provisions of an approved plan, is subject to a civil penalty.
               The maximum civil penalty amount that the county may assess per violation is $5,000.00.
               A civil penalty may be assessed from the date of the violation. Each day of a continuing
               violation shall constitute a separate violation. When the person has not been assessed
               any civil penalty under this subsection for any previous violation, and that person
               abated continuing environmental damage resulting from the violation within 180 days
               from the date of the notice of violation, the maximum cumulative total civil penalty
               assessed under this subsection for all violations associated with the land-disturbing
               activity for which the erosion and sedimentation control plan is required is $25,000.00.
