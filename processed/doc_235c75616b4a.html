               The county commissioners, upon the recommendation of the hazardous waste and/or low-level
               radioactive waste management board, may specify conditions on granting a permit, that
               will, in their opinion, ensure that the facility in its proposed location will meet
               the findings required in<a href="" data-chunk-id="PTIICOOR_CH26EN_ARTXHAWALVERAWAMA_S26-313APPR" class="section-link" data-product-id="14529"> section 26-313</a>(h). All such specified conditions shall be entered in the minutes of the meeting
               at which the permit request is approved. All specified conditions shall run with the
               permit and shall also be binding on the original applicants, their heirs, successors
               and assigns. Any noncompliance with the specified conditions constitutes violation
               of this article and may invalidate the permit.
