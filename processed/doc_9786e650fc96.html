               Cats and ferrets shall not be required to wear the rabies vaccination tag referred
               to in <a href="" data-chunk-id="COOR_CH6AN_ARTIIRACO_S6-28VATA" class="section-link" data-product-id="13891">section 6-28</a>, but the owner of a cat or ferret must maintain the rabies vaccination certificates
               as written evidence to prove that the cat or ferret has a current rabies vaccination.
               Upon determining that the owner of a cat or ferret cannot promptly provide the rabies
               vaccination certificate, the animal control officer may issue a written warning instructing
               the owner to provide the rabies vaccination certificate or to have the cat or ferret
               vaccinated. If an additional violation of this article occurs after the owner of the
               cat or ferret has been issued a written warning, the cat or ferret shall be impounded
               and the owner shall be subject to a civil penalty as indicated in <a href="" data-chunk-id="COOR_CH6AN_ARTIINGE_S6-10SAPE" class="section-link" data-product-id="13891">section 6-10</a>.
