               If the alarm administrator denies the issuance or renewal of a permit, or suspends
               or revokes a permit, he/she shall send written notice of this action and a statement
               of the right to an appeal, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to both the
               applicant or alarm user and the alarm business. The applicant or alarm user may appeal
               the decision of the alarm administrator to the alarm review authority by filing a
               written request for a review setting forth the reasons for the appeal within 20 days
               after receipt of the notice from the alarm administrator. An alarm business may submit
               the request for review on behalf of an alarm user.

               Filing of a request for appeal shall stay the action by the alarm administrator suspending
               or revoking a permit until the alarm review authority has completed the review. If
               a request for appeal is not made within the 20 period, the action of the alarm administrator
               is final.

               The alarm review authority shall conduct a formal hearing and consider the evidence
               offered by any interested person(s). The authority shall make a decision on the basis
               of a preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing including, but not limited
               to, certification that alarm users have been retrained, that a defective part has
               been repaired or replaced, or that the cause of the false alarm has been otherwise
               determined and corrected. The authority shall render a written decision within 30
               days after the request for an appeal hearing is filed. The authority may affirm, reverse,
               or modify the action of the alarm administrator. The decision of the authority is
               a final administrative decision of the county.
