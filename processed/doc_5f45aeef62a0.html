               In keeping with the desire of the county to enact programs that are essential to reducing
               the number of animals entering the county's shelter and adoption center, increasing
               the save rate of healthy, adoptable animals, and reducing pet overpopulation, programs
               shall be enacted and provided to promote the spaying and neutering of dogs and cats
               as well as other life-saving methods.

               creating a sterilization program targeting hard-to-adopt animals; and collaborating
               with other animal welfare organizations to increase public access to low-cost spay
               and neuter services.
