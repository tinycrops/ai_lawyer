               The County of Cabarrus finds that the development of a cable television system has
               the potential of having great benefit and impact upon the people of Cabarrus. Because
               of the complex and rapidly changing technology associated with cable television, the
               county further finds that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can best
               be served by establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the county or
               such persons as the county shall designate. It is the intent of this chapter and subsequent
               amendments to provide for and specify the means to attain the best possible public
               interest and public purpose in these matters and any franchise issued pursuant to
               this chapter shall be deemed to include this finding as an integral part thereof.

               Further, it is recognized that cable television systems have the capacity to provide
               not only entertainment and information services to the county's residents, but can
               provide a variety of broadband, interactive communications services to institutions
               and individuals. Many of these services involve county agencies and other public institutions,
               by providing governmental, educational or health care communications.
