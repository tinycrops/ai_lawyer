               The counties of Catawba, Iredell, Lincoln and Mecklenburg are authorized by joint
               resolution to create the Lake Norman Marine Commission. The commission shall enjoy
               the powers and have the duties and responsibilities conferred upon it by joint resolution,
               subject to this article. The provisions of any joint resolution may be modified, amended
               or rescinded by a subsequent joint resolution. A county may unilaterally withdraw
               from participation as required by any joint resolution or this article, once the commission
               has been created, and any county may unilaterally withdraw from the commission at
               the end of any budget period. Upon the effectuation of such withdrawal, the commission
               is dissolved until reestablished under this article or any successor act of the state,
               and all property of the commission shall be distributed to or divided among the four
               counties and any other public agency serving the Lake Norman area in a manner deemed
               equitable by the four counties.
