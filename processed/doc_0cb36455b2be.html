               Any animal which appears to be lost, stray, unwanted, or which is found not wearing
               a valid rabies vaccination tag as required by state law or this chapter, and not under
               restraint in violation of this chapter, shall be impounded by the animal services
               department by any means necessary and confined in the county animal services center
               in a humane manner. Impoundment of such animal shall not relieve the owner thereof
               from any penalty which may be imposed for violation of this chapter. All impounded
               animals will be scanned for a microchip to aid in the notification of the legal owner.
