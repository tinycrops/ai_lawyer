               It is the basic function of the commission to promote recreation for county citizens
               and, in so doing, the department of recreation and its commission are authorized to
               aid and assist agencies (in line with reasonable and legally correct policies recommended
               by the commission and accepted by the county) which include public; private; commercial;
               those which are quasi-public in character, and which, although public in nature, are
               not under the board of commissioners, such as schools, churches, hospitals, military
               installations, orphanages, commercial recreation, business and industrial agencies;
               as well as civic, neighborhood and service groups in their recreation interest and
