               of profit of more than 2,000 people but less than 5,000 people for a continuous period
               of more than 24 hours or more than 2,000 people for a continuous period of at least
               six hours but less than 24 hours. The term "mass gathering" shall include gatherings
               in open space, open air, or in permanent structures or buildings, but assemblies in
               a permanent building or structure shall include only those which by reason of their
               size the county health director determines to be likely to pose a threat to public
               health, safety or welfare through unsatisfactory provisions of public safety, fire
               and sanitary facilities. The period of duration of the gathering or assembly shall
               be interpreted as commencing when people begin to assemble on the premises and ending
               when all people have left the premises.
