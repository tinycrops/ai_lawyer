            PREFACE
            </p><p class="p0">
            This Code is a codification of the ordinances of Cleveland County of a general and
            permanent nature.
            </p><p class="p0">
            Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by
            the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history
            note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates
            that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the
            Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this volume, the reader
            can locate any ordinance included herein.
            </p><p class="p0">
            The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order and
            the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage.
            Footnotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant
            state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting
            forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume.
            </p><p class="bc0">
            <span class="ital">Numbering System</span>
            </p><p class="p0">
            The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local
            government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The
            figure before the dash refers to the chapter number and the figure after the dash
            refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section
            of <a href="" data-chunk-id="COOR_CH1GEPR" class="section-link" data-product-id="12207">Chapter 1</a> is numbered <a href="" data-chunk-id="COOR_CH1GEPR_S1-2DERUCO" class="section-link" data-product-id="12207">1-2</a> and the first section of <a href="" data-chunk-id="COOR_CH4EMMAEMSE" class="section-link" data-product-id="12207">Chapter 4</a> is <a href="" data-chunk-id="COOR_CH4EMMAEMSE_ARTIINGE_S4-1CH9-1-1SE" class="section-link" data-product-id="12207">4-1</a>. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter and at the same time
            new sections or even whole chapters can be inserted in their proper place by using
            the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of three
            sections that would logically come between sections 3-16 and 3-17 is desired to be
            added, such new sections would be numbered 3-16.1, 3-16.2 and 3-16.3 respectively.
            New chapters may be included in the same manner. If the new material is to be included
            between <a href="" data-chunk-id="COOR_CH2AD" class="section-link" data-product-id="12207">Chapters 2</a> and 3, it will be designated as Chapter 2.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical
            arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles and
            new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be
            placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions,
            may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject, the next successive
            number shall be assigned to the new article or division.
            </p><p class="bc0">
            <span class="ital">Index</span>
            </p><p class="p0">
            The general index of the Code has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular
            item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology,
            others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local
            government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the
            index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in
            which the user is interested.
            </p><p class="bc0">
            <span class="ital">Looseleaf Supplements</span>
            </p><p class="p0">
            A special feature of this Code is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental
            servicing for the Code. With this system, the Code will be kept up-to-date periodically.
            Upon the final passage of amendatory ordinances, they will be properly edited and
            the appropriate page or pages affected will be reprinted. These new pages will be
            distributed to holders of copies of the Code, with instructions for the manner of
            inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. Each such amendment, when
            incorporated into this Code, may be cited as a part hereof.
            </p><p class="p0">
            The successful maintenance of this Code up-to-date at all times will depend largely
            upon the holder of the volume. As revised sheets are received, it will then become
            the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the
            attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments
            be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that
            all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.
            </p><p class="bc0">

            The publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising
            Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully
            given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and
            able assistance throughout the project.
            </p><p class="p0">
            The publisher is most grateful to Mr. R. L. Alexander, County Manager, Mr. Bob Yelton,
            County Attorney, and Ms. Patricia Costner, Clerk to the Board of Commissioners, for
            their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this Code. It
            is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of
            Ordinances which will make the active law of the County readily accessible to all
            citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the
            County's affairs.
