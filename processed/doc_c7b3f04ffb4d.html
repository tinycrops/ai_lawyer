               From and after the designation of an historic district, no exterior portion of any
               building or other structure, including stone or masonry walls, fences, light fixtures,
               steps and pavement, or other appurtenant features; nor aboveground utility structure;
               nor any type of outdoor advertising sign shall be erected, altered, restored, moved
               or demolished within such district until after an application for a certificate of
               appropriateness as to exterior features has been submitted to and approved by the
               resources commission. Further, no archaeological resource associated with such a structure
               shall be altered, moved or removed within such district until after an application
               for a certificate of appropriateness as to the archaeological evidence has been submitted
               to and approved by the resources commission. The governing body shall require such
               a certificate to be issued by the commission prior to the issuance of a building permit
               or other permit granted for purposes of constructing, altering, moving or demolishing
               structures, which certificate may be issued, subject to reasonable conditions necessary
               to carry out the purposes of this division. A certificate of appropriateness shall
               be required whether or not a building or other permit is required.

               may, in the discretion of the local governing board, include color and important landscape
               natural features of the area.

               take such action as may reasonably be required to inform the owners of any property

               and such owners an opportunity to be heard. In cases where the commission deems it
               necessary, it may hold a public hearing concerning the application made by the property
               owners. An appeal may be taken to the board of adjustment from the commission's action
               in granting or denying the certificate in the same manner as any other appeal to such
               board. Any appeal from the board of adjustment's decision in any such case shall be
               heard by the county superior court in which the municipality is located.

               to the resources commission or made orally at any public hearing held in connection
               with the application. The commission shall consider these comments and recommendations
