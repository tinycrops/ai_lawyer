               From and after the designation of an historic district, no building or structure therein
               shall be demolished or otherwise removed until the owner thereof shall have given
               the resources commission 180 days' written notice of his proposed action. During such
               180-day period, the resources commission may negotiate with the owner and with any
               other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the building. If the resources
               commission finds that the building involved has no particular historic significance
               or value toward maintaining the character of the district, it may waive all or part
               of such 180-day period and authorize earlier demolition or removal. However, nothing
               herein shall prevent the property owner from demolishing the structures after the
               expiration of the 180-day period.
