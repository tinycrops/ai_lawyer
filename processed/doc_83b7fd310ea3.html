               <span class="ital">Notice of violation.</span> If the county determines that a person engaged in land-disturbing activity has failed
               to comply with the Act, this chapter, or rules, or orders adopted or issued pursuant
               to this chapter, a notice of violation shall be served upon that person. The notice
               may be served by any means authorized under GS 1A-1, Rule 4. The notice shall specify
               a date by which the person must comply with the Act, this chapter, or rules, or orders
               adopted pursuant to this chapter, and inform the person of the actions that need to
               be taken to comply with the Act, this chapter, or rules or orders adopted pursuant
               to this chapter. Any person who fails to comply within the time specified in the notice
               is subject to additional civil and criminal penalties for a continuing violation as
               provided in G.S. 113A- 64 and this chapter. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing
               activity has not received a previous notice of violation under this section, the county
               shall deliver the notice of violation in person and shall offer assistance in developing
               corrective measures. Assistance may be provided by referral to a technical assistance
               program on behalf of the approving authority, referral to a cooperative extension
               program, or by the provision of written materials such as department guidance documents.
               If the county is unable to deliver the notice of violation in person within 15 days
               following discovery of the violation, the notice of violation may be served in the
               manner prescribed for service of process by G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4, and shall include information
               on how to obtain assistance in developing corrective measures.
