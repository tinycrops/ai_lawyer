               If, upon such hearing, the building inspector shall find that the building or structure
               in question is in such a dilapidated or substandard state of disrepair as to constitute
               a fire or safety hazard or to be dangerous to life, health or other property, or is
               a public nuisance, he shall make an order in writing, directed to the owner of the
               building or structure, requiring the owner to remedy such conditions so found to exist
               by demolishing and removing the building or structure or taking such other steps as
               may be necessary to abate the nuisance. The owner shall remove the hazards within
               not less than 60 days, as the building inspector may prescribe.
