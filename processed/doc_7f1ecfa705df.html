               Under the statutory authority granted in G.S. 153A-185â€”153A-210, a county may make
               special assessments against property within the county for the causes of construction,
               paving, and otherwise building and improving streets. The procedural steps in this
               article shall be in effect for street improvement assessments and are based on the
               provisions G.S. 153A-185â€”153A-210. If it shall be determined that these steps conflict
               with G.S. 153A-185â€”153A-210, the provisions of G.S. 153A-185â€”153A-210 shall prevail.
