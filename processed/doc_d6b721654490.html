               The county may exercise appropriate regulatory authority under this article and applicable
               law. This authority shall be vested in the commission and administered through the
               county manager in order to provide day-to-day administration and enforcement of this
               article and any franchise granted under this article and to carry out the county's
               responsibilities with regard to cable communications.

               Notwithstanding any other section of this article to the contrary, the grantee shall
               at all times comply with all laws and regulations of the local, state and federal
               government. If any actions of the state or federal government or any agency thereof
               or any court of competent jurisdiction upon final adjudication substantially reduce
               in any way the power or authority of the county under this article or the franchise
               or if, in compliance with any local, state, or federal law or regulation, the grantee
               finds conflict with the terms of this article, the franchise, or any law or regulation
               of the county, as soon as possible following knowledge thereof, the grantee shall
               notify the county of the point of conflict believed to exist between such law or regulation
               and the laws or regulations of the county, this article and the franchise. The county,
               at its option, may notify the grantee that it wishes to negotiate those provisions
               which are affected in any way by such modification in regulations or statutory authority.
               Thereafter, the grantee shall negotiate in good faith with the county in the development
               of alternate provisions which shall fairly restore the county to the maximum level
               of authority and power permitted by law. The county shall have the right to modify
               any of the provisions to such reasonable extent as may be necessary to carry out the
               full intent and purpose of this article and the franchise.

               The county reserves the right to exercise the maximum plenary authority, as may at
               any time be lawfully permissible, to regulate the cable communications system, the
               franchise and the grantee. Should applicable legislative, judicial or regulatory authorities
               at any time permit regulation not presently permitted to the county, the county may
               without the approval of the grantee engage in any such additional regulation as may
               then be permissible, whether or not contemplated by this article or the franchise,
               including without limitation regulation regarding franchise fees, taxes, programming,
               rates charged to subscribers and users, consumer protection, or any other similar
               or dissimilar matter.
