               is to effect the conduct of the owner of an animal by seeking to have an owner responsibly
               maintain sufficient restraint and confinement of his/her animal. Therefore, an owner
               of an animal shall be subject to escalating penalties for each violation of subsection
               (a) of this section allowed by the owner, whether the animal is the same animal, a
               different animal, or various animals belonging to the owner. Each violation of subsection
               (a) of this section shall be punishable as a misdemeanor and subject the owner to
               the following escalating citation penalties:
