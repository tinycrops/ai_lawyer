               Approval of an application for issuance or renewal of a license required by this division
               by the sheriff shall be granted if he is satisfied as to the qualifications of the
               applicant, the correctness of the information contained in the application, the good
               moral character of the applicant or of the officers of a corporate applicant. If the
               license is denied because the sheriff is not so satisfied, the applicant shall be
               notified of the denial and the reasons therefor and, upon his request at the reasonable
               convenience of the board of commissioners, the applicant shall be granted an opportunity
               to appear before the board and to be heard with respect to his application. After
               such hearing, the board may grant or deny the license.
