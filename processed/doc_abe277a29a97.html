               Unless otherwise provided for in a particular section, the animal services division
               is authorized to assess civil penalties, the maximum amount of which may be in excess
               of $50.00, pursuant to the county fee schedule adopted by the board of commissioners.
               </p>
            <p class="p0">
               A civil penalty is due and owed upon assessment. Surrender of an animal or failure
               to redeem an animal shall not relieve the owner of responsibility for payment of any
               outstanding civil penalty that was assessed prior to the animal being surrendered
               or as a result of the animal being impounded. If payment of a civil penalty is not
               received within five business days of issuance, animal services may initiate legal
               proceedings to recover the amount of the penalty.
               </p>
            <p class="p0">
               The county manager, or his/her designee, shall have the authority to remit or waive
               certain civil penalties, fines and fees related to animal services, when it is in
               the best interest of the county and its citizens to do so.
