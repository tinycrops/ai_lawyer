               wastewater discharge permit and/or other documents issued by or entered into with
               WSACC, shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the
               name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates the analyses were performed; who
               performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results
               of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three
               years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation
               concerning the user's discharge to the POTW unless otherwise ordered by the court
               in which litigation is pending, or where the user has been specifically notified of
               a longer retention period by the executive director.
