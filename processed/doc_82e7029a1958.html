               Each park and recreation facility should be posted to the effect that registered sex
               offenders are prohibited so that such persons and the general public are made aware
               of this article. Notwithstanding this section concerning signage, it shall not be
               a defense to a prosecution under this article that the park or recreation facility
               contained no signage.
