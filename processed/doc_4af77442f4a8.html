               Under this article, when the total cost of the project has been determined, a proposed
               preliminary assessment roll shall be prepared by the county zoning administrator.
               The roll shall contain a brief description of each lot, parcel, or tract of land assessed;
               the basis for the assessment; the amount assessed against each; the terms of payment;
               and the name of the owner of each lot, parcel, or tract. A map of the project on which
               is shown each lot, parcel, or tract assessed may serve as a sufficient assessment
               roll.
