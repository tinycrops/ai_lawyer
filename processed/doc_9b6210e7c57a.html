            after not less than 10 days' public notice and after a public hearing held pursuant
            thereto, levy a room occupancy tax of three percent (3%) of the gross receipts derived
            from the rental of any room, lodging, or accommodation furnished by a hotel, motel,
            inn, tourist camp, or similar place within the county that is subject to sales tax

            Collection. Every operator of a business subject to the tax levied under this section

            paid by the purchaser to the operator of the business as trustee for and on account

            the necessary forms for filing returns and instructions to ensure the full collection
            of the tax. An operator of a business who collects the occupancy tax levied under

            percent (3%) of the amount collected.

            tax accrues. Every person, firm, corporation, or association liable for the tax shall,

            the tax, there shall be an additional tax, as a penalty, of five percent (5%) of the
