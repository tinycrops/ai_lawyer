               A property which has been designated as an historic property by ordinance as provided
               in this article may, after notice has been made to the owner, as provided in G.S.
               160D-940, be demolished, materially altered, remodeled or removed only after 180 days'
               written notice of the owner's proposed action has been given to the historic resources
               commission. During this period, the commission may negotiate with the owner and with
               any other parties in an effort to find a means of preserving the property. During
               this period, or at any time prior thereto following notice of designation to the owner,
               as provided in<a href="" data-chunk-id="COOR_CH38HIPR_ARTIVHIPR_DIV4OR_S38-141REPR" class="section-link" data-product-id="12776"> section 38-141</a>(a)(5), and, where such action is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the continued
               preservation of the property, the commission may enter into negotiations with the
               owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchanges or otherwise of the property
               or any interest therein authorized by G.S. 160D-940 et seq. The commission may reduce
               the waiting period required by this section in any case where the owner would suffer
               extreme hardship, not including loss of profit, unless a reduction in the required
               waiting period were allowed. The commission shall have the discretionary authority
               to waive all or any portion of the required waiting period, provided that the alteration,
               remodeling or removal is undertaken subject to conditions agreed to by the commission
               ensuring the continued maintenance of the architectural or historical integrity and
               character of the property.
