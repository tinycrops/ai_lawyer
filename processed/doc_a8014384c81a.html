               According to G.S. รยง 143-129(b), the county has no authority to establish preferences
               of any kind and is bound by law to award to the lowest responsible bidder, taking
               into consideration quality, performance and time specified in the proposals for the
               performance of the contract. However, it is the desire of the county to contract with
               vendors and contractors located within the county whenever possible. The purchasing
               office shall update departments of new local vendors and contractors and encourage
               departments to obtain quotes from local vendors when appropriate.
