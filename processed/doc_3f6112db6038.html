               All fires, excluding personal smoking materials, are prohibited except in designated
               areas. Park and other authorized county employees, their agents, and contractors may
               prohibit fires in designated areas and smoking when a fire hazard makes such action
               necessary. A competent person 16 years old or older must continuously tend any fire
               from the time it is kindled until it is extinguished.
