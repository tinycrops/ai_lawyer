               If the owner does not appeal from the final order or direction of the building inspector
               requiring that the building or structure is demolished and removed, or if the taking
               of such other steps were required to abate the nuisance and remove the hazards, and
               the owner fails or refuses to comply with such order and direction, it shall be the
               duty of the building inspector to file a written report thereof with the clerk to
               the board of commissioners, who shall cause such report to be placed on the agenda
               for action by the board of commissioners at its next ensuing regular meeting or to
               some subsequent meeting to which the board of commissioners may continue the same.
               The building inspector shall mail a copy of the report by certified or registered
               mail to the owner at his last known address, or have a copy of the report delivered
               to the owner. The report shall specify the date of the meeting of the board of commissioners
               for which the matter will be docketed for action.
