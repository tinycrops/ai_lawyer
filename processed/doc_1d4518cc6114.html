               Upon complying with G.S. 160D-946, the governing body may adopt and from time to time
               amend or repeal an ordinance designating one or more historic properties. No property
               shall be recommended for designation as a historic property unless it is deemed and
               found by the properties commission to be of special significance in terms of its history,
               architecture, and/or cultural or archaeological importance, and to possess integrity
               of design, setting, workmanship, materials, feeling and/or association. In addition,
               the governing body may consider also the suitability of the property for preservation
               or restoration; educational value; cost of acquisition, restoration, maintenance,
               operation or repair; possibilities for adaptive or alternative use of the property;
               appraised value; and the administrative and financial responsibility of any person
               or organization willing to underwrite all or a portion of the costs.

               The ordinance shall describe each property designated in the ordinance, the name of
               the owner of the property, and any other information the governing board deems necessary
               within the authority of this article and G.S. 160D-940 et seq. For each building,
               structure, site, area or object designated as an historic property, the ordinance
               shall require that a 180-day waiting period is observed prior to its demolition, material
               alteration, remodeling or removal. For each designated historic property, the ordinance
               shall also provide for a suitable sign on the property stating that the property has
               been designated. If the owner consents, the sign shall be placed upon the property.
               If the owner objects, the sign shall be placed on a nearby public right-of-way.
