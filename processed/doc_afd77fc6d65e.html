               Except as limited in subsection (b) of this section by restrictions in any joint resolution
               and by other supervening provisions of law, the Lake Norman Marine Commission may
               make regulations applicable to Lake Norman and its shoreline area concerning all matters
               relating to or affecting public recreation and water safety. These regulations may
               not conflict with or supersede provisions of general or special acts of the state
               or of regulations of state agencies promulgated under the authority of general law.
               In lieu of or in addition to passing regulations supplementary to state law and regulations
               concerning the operation of vessels on Lake Norman, the commission may, after public
               notice, request that the wildlife commission pass local regulations on this subject.

               date as may be stipulated in the regulations, except that no regulation may be enforced
               unless adequate notice of the regulation has been posted in or on Lake Norman or its
               shoreline area. Adequate notice as to a regulation affecting only a particular location
               may be by a sign, uniform waterway marker, posted notice, or other effective method
               of communicating the essential provisions of the regulation in the immediate vicinity
               of the location in question. Where a regulation applies generally as to Lake Norman

               communicating the essential provisions in at least three different places throughout
               the area.
