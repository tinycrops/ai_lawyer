               <span class="ital">Registration</span>. A current registration shall be maintained by the animal services division for every
               dog determined to be dangerous or potentially dangerous. The owner of the dog is responsible
               for ensuring that the dog is registered. Registrations must include the name and address
               of the owner, identifying information concerning the dog, a copy of the certificate
               of insurance, verification of current rabies vaccination, and any other information
               the animal services division deems necessary. The owner shall register the dog annually
               with the animal services division during the month of January. If the dog dies, the
               owner is responsible for notifying animal services immediately. If ownership is transferred,
               subsection (2) below applies.

               <span class="ital">Transfer</span>. If the owner of a potentially dangerous or dangerous dog transfers ownership or
               possession of the dog to another person, the owner must, not less than ten calendar
               days prior to the transfer, provide written notice to the director of emergency services
               stating the intent to transfer the dog and the name, telephone number, and address
               of the new owner or possessor of the dog. The new owner must assume all responsibilities
               regarding the dangerous or potentially dangerous dog. The director of emergency services
               must inspect the new, proposed location to ensure compliance with the written order
               prior to the dog's relocation. If the location does not fall under the jurisdiction
               of this article, the director of emergency services shall contact the appropriate
               animal control or law enforcement agency of the owner's intent to relocate the dog
               in question to a location within such agency's jurisdiction, and shall provide copies
               of all records pertaining to the dog to the agency prior to the dog's relocation.
