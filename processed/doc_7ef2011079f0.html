               Any dog which appears to be lost, stray, and which is found to be not wearing a currently
               valid rabies vaccination tag, as required by state law or this chapter, and not under
               restraint in violation of this chapter, shall be impounded by the animal control department
               and confined in an animal shelter in a humane manner. Impoundment of such an animal
               shall not relieve the owner thereof from any penalty which may be imposed for violation
               of this chapter.
