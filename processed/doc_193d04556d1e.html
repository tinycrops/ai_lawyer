               Cabarrus County has established agricultural districts to protect and preserve agricultural
               lands and activities. These districts have been developed and mapped by the county
               to inform all purchasers of real property that certain agricultural and forestry activities,
               including but not limited to pesticide spraying, manure spreading, machinery and truck
               operation, livestock operations, sawing, and other common farming activities may occur
               in these districts any time during the day or night. Maps and information on the location
               and establishment of these districts can be obtained from the North Carolina Cooperative
               Extension Service office, the office of the register of deeds, the county planning
               office, or the natural resources conservation service office.

               on the official county planning map without the approval of the board of commissioners.
               Districts located in growth corridors designated after the effective date of this
               program may remain, but shall not be expanded within the growth corridor area without
               the approval of the board of commissioners.
