               The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for
               regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering consideration. Larger
               floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade
               or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special
               flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
               damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the county, or on
               any officer or employee thereof, for any flood damages that result from reliance on
               this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made under this chapter.
