               During the design development stage, the architect or engineer must furnish a written
               cost estimate for the project. If, in the architect's or engineer's opinion, budgeted
               funds are not sufficient to accomplish all work specified, a written report must be
               furnished to the director, who in his exclusive discretion shall determine whether
               and how to modify the project or terminate the project.
