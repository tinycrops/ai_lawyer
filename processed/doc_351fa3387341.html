               Prior to commencement of services on any project under this article, the architect,
               engineer or surveyor must execute a mutually acceptable contract with the appropriate
               owner for those services. The construction budget for a project shall be certified
               by the owner, who shall provide the architects or engineers/surveyors with a copy
               thereof. Funds appropriated for a particular project must be used exclusively for
               that project. It is the architect's, engineer's or surveyor's responsibility to keep
               a project within budget. The work bid must reflect the architect's or engineer's opinion
               about what can be done within the budget. Where questions arise as to the amount of
               work which can be accomplished within the budget, an agreement must be reached with
               the owner concerning acceptable alternatives, if any. Alternatives that cannot be
               completed within the project budget or that are beyond the scope of the original project
               shall be discussed with the respective owner's board.
