                  No proposed building lot that is partially subject to flooding shall be approved,
                  unless there is established on the lot a line representing an actual contour at an
                  elevation two feet above the 100-year flood. Such line shall be known as the building
                  restriction flood line. No filling shall be permitted in the 100-year flood area.
                  All buildings or structures designed or intended for use shall be located on such
                  a lot so that the lowest usable and functional part of the structure shall not be
                  below the elevation of building restriction flood line. The term "usable and functional
                  part of the structure" is defined as being inclusive of living areas, basements, sunken
                  dens, utility rooms, attached carports and mechanical appurtenances, such as furnaces,
                  air conditioners, water pumps, electrical conduits and wiring, but shall not include
                  water lines or sanitary sewer traps, piping and clean-outs, provided openings serving
                  the structure are above the building restriction flood line. Where only a portion
                  of the proposed building lot is subject to flooding, such a lot may be approved only
                  if there will be available for building a usable lot area of not less than 10,000
                  square feet. The usable lot area shall be determined by deducting from the total area
                  of the setback required by the county zoning ordinance and any remaining area of lot
                  lying below the building restriction flood line.
