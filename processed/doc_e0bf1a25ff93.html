               The intent of this article is to protect the public health and the environment through
               the deconstruction of abandoned manufactured homes to reduce blight and attractive
               nuisances. It is a policy of the county to promote the removal of reusable or recyclable
               materials to reduce the impact of such solid wastes and production of said materials
               on the environment.
