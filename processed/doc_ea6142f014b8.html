               qualifying farmland may revoke the preservation agreement or the advisory board may
               revoke the same preservation agreement based on noncompliance by the landowner, subject
               to the same provisions as contained in<a href="" data-chunk-id="PTIICOOR_CH32FAPR_ARTIVPRHENO_S32-64AP" class="section-link" data-product-id="12658"> section 32-64</a> for appeal of denials. Such revocation shall result in loss of qualifying farm status
               and loss of eligibility to participate in a district. Absent noncompliance by the
               landowner, neither the advisory board nor the board of commissioners shall revoke
               any preservation agreements prior to its expiration.
