               Prior to accepting applications for the operation of an ambulance service, the board
               of commissioners may designate specific service areas as franchise districts. The
               districts will be established using criteria that include geographic size, road access,
               the location of existing medical transportation services, population, and response
               time. The county shall have the authority to redistrict or rearrange existing districts
               at any time at its discretion.
