               No poles shall be erected by the grantee without prior approval of the county with
               regard to location, height, type and any other pertinent aspect. However, no location
               of any pole of the grantee shall be a vested right and such poles shall be removed
               or modified by the grantee at its own expense whenever the county determines that
               the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. Grantee shall utilize existing poles
               and conduits, where possible. The county shall have the right, during the life of
               the franchise, to install and maintain free of charge upon the poles owned by the
               grantee, any wire and pole fixtures that do not unreasonably interfere with the cable
               system operations of the grantee. The county shall indemnify and hold the grantee
               harmless from any claim or action found to be caused by the intentional or negligent
               act or omission of county, its employees, agents, or subcontractors.
