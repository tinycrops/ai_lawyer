               the franchise, pursuant to this article and the franchise, or (ii) the franchise is
               not renewed at the normal expiration of the franchise term and the grantee has exhausted
               all rights to renewal under the Cable Act, the county shall have the right, directly
               or as an intermediary, to purchase the cable communications system or effect the ownership
               of the system to another person. For nonrenewal, any such acquisition or transfer
               shall be at fair market value, determined on the basis of the cable system valued
               as a going concern. If the franchise is revoked for cause, the acquisition or transfer
               shall be at an equitable price.
