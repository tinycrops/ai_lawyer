               In order to protect the health, welfare and safety of those persons in attendance
               at mass gatherings and of other persons who may be affected by mass gatherings and
               to carry out the provisions of this chapter, the county health director shall require
               the permittee within five days after the issuance of the provisional permit to file
               with the county manager a performance bond or cash bond or other surety to be executed
               to the county in the amount of $5,000.00 for up to 10,000 persons and $1,000.00 additional
               for each additional 5,000 persons or fraction thereof reasonably estimated to attend
               the mass gathering. The bond, if required, shall be conditioned on full compliance
               with this chapter and shall be forfeitable upon noncompliance and a showing by the
               county health director or county manager of any injury, damage or extraordinary and
               unusual costs or other loss to the county or local governmental agencies caused by
               the noncompliance. The permittee shall in addition file satisfactory evidence of public
               liability and property damage insurance in an amount determined by the county manager
               to be reasonable, but not to exceed $1,000,000.00, in relation to the risks and hazards
               involved in the proposed mass gathering.
