               The planning board shall consist of nine members appointed at large by the board of
               commissioners to serve three-year terms. Each member of the board shall be a legal
               resident of the county at the time of his appointment and shall maintain his residency
               during his term of appointment. The initial members shall serve staggered terms. Their
               successors shall be appointed to full three-year terms. Vacancies occurring for reasons
               other than expiration of terms shall be filled by the board of commissioners as they
               occur for the period of the unexpired term. Faithful attendance at the meetings of
               the planning board is considered a prerequisite for the maintenance of membership
               on the planning board.
