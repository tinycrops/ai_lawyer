               The emergency management agency will be the coordinating agency for all activity in
               connection with emergency management. It will be the instrument through which the
               board of commissioners may exercise its authority and discharge the responsibilities
               vested in it during an emergency.

               or authority given to it in the county charter, local ordinances, or state law nor

               emergencies.
