               <span class="ital">Purpose.</span> This policy establishes the procedure the Soil and Water Conservation District shall
               follow in the event of an easement violation and the assessment of the appropriate
               enforcement action. The Soil and Water Conservation District is legally obligated
               to enforce the terms of its conservation easements. In addition to protecting the
               conservation values of the land, enforcement is necessary to generate public confidence
               in the Soil and Water Conservation District's mission to conserve land, to uphold
               the organization's legal authority to enforce the terms of its conservation easements,
               and to maintain the ability to accept future donations of easements and its tax-exempt
               status. The Soil and Water Conservation District may discover a violation on a monitoring
               visit, through a neighbor or other interested party, or during informal observation.
               It is important to note that a violation may have been caused by the landowner, an
               adjacent property owner or a trespasser. The Soil and Water Conservation District's
               first response must be twofold: thoroughly document the violation, and contact the
               landowner to discuss and understand the situation. The Soil and Water Conservation
               District's response to a violation should match the severity of the violation. Minor
               infractions (i.e., roadside trash, minor tree cutting) may warrant a written acknowledgement
               of the violation from Soil and Water Conservation District staff. The more egregious
               transgressions (e.g. construction, excavation, timber harvest, hazardous material
               dumping) require a swift and formal response.
