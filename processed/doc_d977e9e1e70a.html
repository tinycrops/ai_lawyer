               As a general policy, the county will not remove a vehicle from private property if
               the owner, occupant, or lessee of such property has the means to remove the vehicle
               under applicable state law procedures. In no case shall a vehicle be removed by the
               county from private property without a written request from the owner, occupant, or
               lessee, except in those cases where a vehicle is a nuisance or junked vehicle which
               has been ordered removed by an authorized official of the county. The county may require
               any person requesting the removal of an abandoned, nuisance, or junked motor vehicle
               from a private property to indemnify the county against any loss, expense, or liability
               incurred because of the removal, storage, or sale thereof.
