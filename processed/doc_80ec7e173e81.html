               hazard. Tires are not suitable for burial in a sanitary landfill nor for burning in
               a municipal solid waste incinerator. All waste tires in the county must be delivered

               disposed of in an environmentally acceptable way. This subsection is not intended
               to prevent any individual, company, or other entity from developing an environmentally
               acceptable method for tire disposal. Any such proposal for an alternate disposal method
               shall be submitted to the department of utilities and engineering for review and final
               approval by the board of commissioners.

               of the domesticated animal or to otherwise dispose of the animal in a manner approved

               domesticated animal closer than 300 feet to any flowing stream or public body of water.
               Dead animals may be disposed of at the county landfill for a fee as prescribed by
               the board of commissioners, Monday through Friday between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and

               of any dead animal located on or within the state department of transportation's right-of-way.
               All costs incurred by a municipality or county in the removal of a dead domesticated
