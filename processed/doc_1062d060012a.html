               Water and/or sewer service to a customer may be discontinued in the event of nonpayment
               on or after the 31st day after the due date. Service shall not be resumed until payment
               of all then due charges and penalties. As a condition to resumption of service, the
               customer may be required to make an advance cash deposit in an amount up to twice
               the average monthly bill to such customer. Such deposit may be applied to the payment
               of future charges. Any funds remaining on deposit upon final termination of service
               to such customer shall be returned to him.
