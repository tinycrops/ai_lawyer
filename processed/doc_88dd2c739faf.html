               This article in part comes forward by re-enactment of some of the provisions of the
               flood damage prevention ordinance enacted August 1, 1980 as amended, and it is not
               the intention to repeal but rather to re-enact and continue to enforce without interruption
               of such existing provisions, so that all rights and liabilities that have accrued
               thereunder are reserved and may be enforced. The enactment of this article shall not
               affect any action, suit or proceeding instituted or pending. All provisions of the
               flood damage prevention ordinance of Buncombe County enacted on August 1, 1980, as
               amended, which are not reenacted herein are repealed.
