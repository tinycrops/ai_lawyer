               In addition to other enforcement and sanction provisions hereunder, violators may
               be punishable by immediate suspension from all properties for not more than 60 days
               for the first offense. Department officials may suspend violators up to one year on
               their first offense dependent on the severity of the offense. Thereafter, suspension
               may be for such time deemed appropriate by the board of commissioners. The department
               director and/or designee (including without limitation, department officials and county
               enforcement authorities) are empowered to invoke and enforce this suspension. An effort
               will be made to send a certified letter to anyone suspended from the facilities advising
               them of why they were banned, how long the suspension is, what facilities are affected,
               and what will happen if they don't abide by the ban.

               In addition to the enforcement and sanction provisions of this chapter, department
               personnel authorized by the board of commissioners as well as county law enforcement
               authorities shall have all enforcement and sanction provisions available to them pursuant
               to the North Carolina General Statutes. This authority shall include without limitation,
               assessment of any state and/or county fines and penalties applicable to any ordinance
               citation. Each person receiving a citation must, within 30 calendar days of its issuance,
               pay as a penalty and in full satisfaction of the fine, the total monetary sum set
               forth in the citation. However, in the event the fine is paid within 14 calendar days
               of issuance of the citation, the county will accept one-half of the full fine amount
               as full and complete satisfaction of the fine. Payment of the fine does not relieve
               the recipient of the citation from compliance with any other requirements set forth
               in the citation. Notwithstanding any other term or condition herein, failure of such
               person to render payment of the full amount of the fine within 30 days of the issuance
               of the citation, may render such person subject to collection proceedings and/or punishment
               for a civil offense or misdemeanor, as set forth herein and in the North Carolina
               General Statutes. Violation fines and penalties may be revised from time to time by
               the board of commissioners and shall be deemed incorporated herein as they may be
               amended from time to time.
