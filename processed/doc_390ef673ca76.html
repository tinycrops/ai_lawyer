               Session Law 1998-62, adopted by the North Carolina General Assembly on July 27, 1998,
               repealed Â§Â§ 3 and 4 of Session Law 1997-452 which provided the authority of the Cabarrus
               County Board of Commissioners to enact provisions for a procedure of direct voting
               on issues by the people. Hence, Â§Â§ 2-21â€”2-27 relating to initiatives, referendums
               and direct voting on questions of public interest were effectively repealed in their
               entirety.
