               This chapter may be amended from time to time by the county commissioners as herein
               specified, but no amendment shall become effective unless it shall have been proposed
               by or shall have been submitted to the planning board for review and recommendation.
               The planning board shall have 45 days from the date of presentation to the planning
               board within which to submit its report. If the planning board fails to submit a report
               within the specified time, it shall be deemed to have recommended approval of the
               amendment. No amendment shall be adopted by the county commissioners until they have
               held a public hearing on the amendment. Notice of the hearing shall be published in
               a newspaper of general circulation in the county at least once a week for two successive
               calendar weeks prior to the hearing. The initial notice shall appear not more than
               25 nor less than ten days prior to the hearing date. In computing the ten- to 25-day
               period, the date of publication is not to be counted, but the date of hearing is.
               The filing fee for an amendment is $75.00, plus the cost for advertisement.
