               WSACC requires the user to provide and operate at the user's expense, monitoring facilities
               to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal
               drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's
               premises, but WSACC may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue
               hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or
               sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked
               vehicles.
