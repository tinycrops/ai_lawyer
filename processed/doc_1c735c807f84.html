               An annual license fee shall be charged for each license and paid prior to the issuance
               of the license. The annual fee shall be established by the board of commissioners
               from time to time and published in the schedule of fees and charges for the county,
               except that the license fee so set shall not exceed the rates set by the state. The
               license fee for any partial year shall be prorated so that the applicant for a license
               shall be required to pay the full annual fee if the application is made during the
               period of time from July 1 through December 31 of each year. Applications made between
               January 1 and June 30 of each year shall pay one-half the regular fee.
