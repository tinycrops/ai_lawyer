               <span class="ital">Intent.</span> Abandoned and junked motor vehicles left in public areas or other visible areas lessen
               the attractive appearance of this community. Often, such vehicles cause dangerous
               traffic conditions which threaten the safety of the citizens of the county. In a similar
               manner, abandoned and junked vehicles left on private property also adversely affect
               community appearance and many times become a collection place for trash and refuse
               and a breeding place for rodents and other pests. Many such vehicles become a nuisance
               even if the vehicle has not been abandoned in the technical sense or become a junked
               motor vehicle as strictly defined in this article. It is the policy of the board of
               commissioners that vehicles which are abandoned, junked, or otherwise a nuisance ought
               to be prohibited in the county. Further, such vehicles and the conditions which surround
               such vehicles shall not be allowed to present a danger to the citizens of the county,
               especially small children who may be attracted to such vehicles. Unless specifically
               allowed by this article, or by some other state law which supersedes this article,
               abandoned, nuisance, and junked motor vehicles on both public and private property
               shall be removed. The county will take an active role in furthering this policy and
               the policy set forth in G.S. 153A-132, 153A-132.2, and 153A-140. In those instances
               when the owner of the vehicle or the property owner refuses to take corrective action,
               the county will take an active role in having vehicles which violate this article
               removed.

               The county, on an annual basis, may contract with private tow truck operators or towing
               and vehicle storage businesses to remove, store, and dispose of abandoned vehicles,
               nuisance vehicles, and junked vehicles in compliance with this article and applicable
               state laws.
