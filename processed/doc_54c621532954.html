               foreclosure proceedings with the tax collector of any municipality within the county
               which shall so agree by appropriate resolution, under G.S. 105-374, to foreclose tax
               liens by action in the nature of an action to foreclose a mortgage. It is the intention
               of this board that the tax collectors of the governing bodies shall employ the county
               attorney for the purpose of initiating such foreclosure proceedings whenever they
               shall jointly decide that foreclosure under G.S. 105-374 is warranted. If this foreclosure
               proceeding is used, the governing bodies shall jointly bear any unrecoverable costs,
               as provided in subsection (a)(6) of this section, of the in rem foreclosure proceedings.
               Subsection (a)(7) of this section of the in rem procedure, relating to joint ownership
               of property purchased by the county tax collector at foreclosure sales, shall also
               apply to foreclosures initiated under G.S. 105-374.
