               be subject to the imposition by citation of a civil penalty for each such violation
               which shall be paid in full within ten days of the service of the citation by a representative
               of the county animal services department or any law enforcement officer in accordance
               with G.S. 153A-123. If the offender does not pay the penalty within ten days, the
               county may recover said penalty plus court costs in a civil action in the nature of
               debt. Failure to correct the violation within the ten-day period will result in an
               additional penalty of $50.00 per violation per day until the violation is corrected.
               All civil penalties are subject to associated legal fees in the collection of delinquent
               penalties.
