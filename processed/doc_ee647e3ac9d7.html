               The service of an order or notice for the correction of violations of this article

               delivering such order or notice to and leaving it with any person in charge of the
               premises or by sending a copy of the order or notice by certified or registered mail

               When buildings or other premises are occupied by one other than the owner under a
               lease or other agreement, the order or notice issued to correct violations of this
               article shall apply to the occupant thereof, provided that where the order or notice
               requires the making of additions to or changes in the premises themselves which may
               become part of the real property of the owner, the order or notice shall also be issued
               to the owner of the premises or real property. Failure to deliver an order or notice
               to the owner, if other than the occupant, shall not invalidate such order or notice.
