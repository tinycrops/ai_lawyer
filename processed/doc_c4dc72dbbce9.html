               If a dog, cat or ferret has a current rabies vaccination and is bitten by or exposed
               to a rabid or potentially rabid animal, the owner of the animal must get it a booster
               rabies vaccination within 96 hours after contact with the possibly rabid animal. Animals
               are not considered vaccinated until the twenty-eighth day after the first vaccination.

               dog, cat or ferret bitten by or exposed shall be confined at the county animal shelter
               until rabies test results have been received. If the test results are negative, the
               animal can be returned to its owner. All fees shall be paid by the owner at the time

               a period up to six months under reasonable conditions imposed by the local health
