               Dogs and cats quarantined under this section shall be confined in a veterinary hospital,
               boarding kennel, or county animal shelter, at the expense of the owner; provided,
               however, that if an animal control officer determines that the owner of an animal
               which must be quarantined has adequate confinement facilities upon his own premises,
               the animal control officer shall authorize the animal to be confined on such premises.
               The animal control officer may not authorize the animal to be confined on the owner's
               premises unless the owner has a fenced-in area in his yard, the fenced-in area has
               no entrances or exits that are not locked, and the animal is currently vaccinated
               against rabies. If the animal is confined on the owner's premises, the animal control
               officer shall revisit the premises for inspection purposes at approximately the middle
               of the confinement period and again at the conclusion of the confinement period.
