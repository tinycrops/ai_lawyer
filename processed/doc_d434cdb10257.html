               It shall be unlawful for any person to obtain or receive ambulance service without
               intending at that time of obtaining or receiving such services to pay, if financially
               able, the necessary charges. A determination that the recipient of such services has
               failed to pay for the services rendered for 90 days after the request for payment,
               and that the recipient is financially able to do so, shall raise a presumption that
               the recipient of the services did not intend to pay for the services at the time they
               were obtained or received.

               Violations of this article, or the terms of any franchise granted under this article,
               shall be punishable by a civil penalty. Each such violation also shall subject the
               offender to a civil penalty in the amount of $100.00 for each separate breach of the
               franchise or violation of this article. This civil penalty must be paid within ten
               days after the hearing on the citation has been held as provided in subsection<a href="" data-chunk-id="COOR_CH22EMSE_ARTIIAMSE_DIV2FR_S22-44TE" class="section-link" data-product-id="12776"> 22-44</a>(b). If not so paid, such penalty may be recovered by the county as provided by G.S.
               153A-123(c). If the civil penalty is not paid within the ten days, as provided for
               in this subsection, the county may suspend or revoke the franchise.
