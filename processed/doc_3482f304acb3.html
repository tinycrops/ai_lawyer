               In addition to the civil penalties, any provision of the code that makes unlawful
               a condition existing upon or use made of real property may be enforced by injunction
               and order abatement by the general court of justice. When a violation of such provision
               occurs, the county may apply to the appropriate division of the general court of justice
               for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and/or order of abatement commanding the
               defendant to correct the unlawful condition or cease the unlawful use of the property.
               The action shall be governed in all respects by the laws and rules governing civil
               proceedings including the rules of civil procedure.

               An order of abatement may direct that the buildings or other structures on the property
               be closed, demolished or removed; that fixtures, furniture or other movable property
               be removed from any building on the property; that abandoned or junked vehicles be
               removed; that improvements or repairs be made; or that any other action be taken that
               is necessary to bring the property into compliance with the N.C. Fire Code. If the
               defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order of abatement
               within the time allowed by the court, he may be cited for contempt, and the county
               may execute the order of abatement. The county shall have a lien on the property for
               the cost of executing an order of abatement in the nature of a mechanic's and material-man's
               lien. The defendant may secure cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all
               cost of the proceedings and posting a bond for compliance with the order. The bond
               shall be given with sureties to the clerk of superior court in an amount approved
               by the judge before whom the matter is heard and shall be conditioned on the defendant's
               full compliance with the terms of the order of abatement within a time fixed by judicial
               order. Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction
               issued in conjunction therewith.
