               The indemnity in subsection (a) of this section is conditioned upon the following:
               The county shall give the grantee prompt notice of any claim or the commencement of
               any action, suit or other proceeding covered by this section. Nothing in this section
               shall be deemed to prevent the county from cooperating with the grantee and participating
               in the defense of any litigation by its own counsel at its own costs and expense.
               No recovery by the county of any sum by reason of the liquidated damages required
               by the franchise shall be subject to litigation by the grantee, except that any sum
               so received by the county shall be deducted from any recovery which the county might
               have against the grantee under the terms of this section.
