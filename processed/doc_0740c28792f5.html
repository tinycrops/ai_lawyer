               This division is not intended to supersede or controvert the regulations of the county
               department of health and the North Carolina Department of Environmental and Natural
               Resources. It is the purpose and intent of this division to protect public health
               and private property by granting one or more exclusive franchises for the collection
               and disposal of residential and household solid wastes to responsible persons or businesses
               equipped to render adequate and continuing service throughout the county, and under
               supervision and regulation by local government agencies, both as to the means and
               method of collection, and also as to the sanitary disposition of solid waste.
