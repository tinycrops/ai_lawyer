               Located within the area of special flood hazard established in<a href="" data-chunk-id="PTIICOOR_CH34FL_ARTIINGE_S34-8BAESARSPFLHA" class="section-link" data-product-id="14529"> section 34-8</a> are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards
               associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel
               does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate.
               The following provisions shall apply within such areas:
