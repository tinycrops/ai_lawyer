               <span class="ital">Paved streets.</span> When a water and/or sewer main is constructed in a paved street, or in a street that
               is to be paved, laterals shall be laid to serve every building lot. It is the purpose
               and policy of the county to install sufficient laterals so as to minimize the excavation
               of streets in order to provide service to abutting lots which are subsequently developed
               and improved; provided, however, each property owner, prior to construction, shall
               be notified by the county of the number of laterals proposed to be laid to serve his
               property. The county shall give each owner reasonable opportunity to object to the
               installation of any of the proposed laterals. Such objections shall be filed in writing
               and shall contain the owner's reason for objection. The county shall have the authority
               to delete from the project laterals which will not be required to adequately serve
               the property. A property owner who objects to the decision of the county as to his
               objections may appeal to the board of commissioners for a final decision.
