               The selling or public distribution of drinks, food and the like must be authorized
               in writing by the parks and recreational director or designee. In some cases, authorization
               may be given through an appropriate contract. Also, authorization may be given only
               after review of health considerations, insurance, and after considering the appropriateness
               of the requested activity considering the time, place and circumstances. It is the
               intent of this article not to discourage church, civic groups and nonprofits from
               utilizing county property when appropriate.
