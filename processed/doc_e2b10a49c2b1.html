               Dogs must wear a collar or harness with a rabies vaccination tag at all times, unless
               the dog is confined in a secure enclosure. Upon determining that a dog is not wearing
               a rabies vaccination tag and the owner cannot promptly display a valid rabies vaccination
               tag, the animal control officer may issue a written warning instructing the owner
               to display the rabies vaccination tag or to have the dog vaccinated. If an additional
               violation of this article occurs after the owner of the dog has been issued a written
               warning, the dog shall be impounded and the owner shall be subject to a civil penalty
