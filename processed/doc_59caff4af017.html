               If during any inspection the fire marshal determines that the fire department is not
               meeting the minimum standards as set forth in this article, a notice of deficiency
               must be given in writing by the fire marshal to the fire chief and at least two officers
               of the corporation of the fire department. This notice shall specify the period of
               time within which the deficiencies must be corrected, provided that the length of
               the period of time shall be reasonable and in any event shall not be less than 15
               days. At the end of the specified period, an inspection shall be made by the fire
               marshal to determine if the deficiencies have been corrected. If the deficiencies
               have not been corrected, the fire marshal shall notify the Cabarrus County Board of
               Commissioners with a recommendation to contract with another department to provide
               service until deficiencies have been corrected.
