               <span class="ital">Overview.</span> Effective in July 1993, the county industrial development commission (IDC) and office
               of business development merged. The name of the corporation was changed to the Catawba
               County Economic Development Corporation to more accurately reflect its status as a
               nonprofit corporation and to distinguish it from industrial development commissions
               and economic development commissions under state law.
