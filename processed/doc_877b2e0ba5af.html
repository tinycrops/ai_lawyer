               Emergency purchasing permission is granted only in extreme cases. During normal working
               hours, if, in the judgment of the department head, an emergency arises which necessitates
               immediate purchase of materials or services to continue with department operations,
               the purchasing manager is notified of the emergency purchase which will be necessary
               and enters the purchase order in the computer system. The purchasing manager then
               processes the purchase order immediately, contacting the finance department for approval.

               After working hours, the department head will decide if an emergency exists and in
               such case will authorize the necessary emergency purchase. A disbursement voucher
               shall be completed for any emergency purchase with an explanation attached.

               In all cases, if the department head is not available, the decision regarding emergencies
               will be made by the finance director or assistant finance director. These procedures
               apply to all county agencies and departments.

               Emergency procedures are not intended for purchases required because of failure to
               anticipate normal needs. Work should be planned in advance and material requirements
               determined so that items can be requisitioned as a regular purchase.
