               The surplus property shall be sold to the party who tenders the highest offer, or
               exchanged for any property or services useful to the county if greater value may be
               obtained in that manner, and the county manager or his designee is hereby authorized
               to execute and deliver any applicable title documents. If no offers are received within
               a reasonable time, the county manager or his designee may retain the property, obtain
               any reasonably available salvage value, or cause it to be disposed of as waste material.
               No surplus property may be donated to any individual or organization except by resolution
               of the board of commissioners.
