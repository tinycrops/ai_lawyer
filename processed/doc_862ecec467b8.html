               The county manager or his designee is authorized on behalf of the county to execute
               and file with the FCC such submissions as are now, or may hereafter, be required by
               FCC rate regulations in order to regulate basic service rates and charges and to establish
               any additional procedures for the county and the franchisee in conformity with FCC
               rate regulations. The county may utilize a rate consultant to advise it on proposed
               rate changes and to assist it in the procedures and the standards for review adopted
               by the FCC. A rate consultant may be any person who has sufficient background and
               experience, in the sole opinion of the county, to properly evaluate and analyze rates
               and charges.
