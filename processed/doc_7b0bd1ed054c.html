               Every property owner with a residential dwelling located on his property, where the
               property is located outside a municipality with a municipal collection system, must
               declare with a franchised solid waste collector between November 1 and December 31
               of each year, whether the property will be serviced by a franchised solid waste collector
               or whether franchised solid waste collection service will be discontinued. If the
               property owner declares with a franchised solid waste collector, the dwelling will
               be exempt from the annual solid waste user fee. If the property owner does not declare
               with a franchised solid waste collector, the property owner shall be subject to the
               annual solid waste user fee as is from time to time assessed by the board of county
               commissioners. Once the annual solid waste user fee has been assessed against a property,
               there will be no refund of the fee during the following year.
