               The planning board may establish an advisory council and may cooperate with this council
               to the end that its investigations and plans may receive fullest consideration, but
               the board may not delegate to such advisory council any of its official prerogatives.
               The planning board may set up special committees to assist it in the study of specific
               questions and problems.
