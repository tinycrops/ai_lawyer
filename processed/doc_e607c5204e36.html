               apply for any needed contracts for pole use. Any pole space or facilities obtained
               from the county shall be agreed upon through a contract for pole use, facility, or
               conduit use, and fees shall be paid to the county for such use as specified in the
               relevant contract(s). Pole space and other facilities obtained from the county, utilities,
               and other lawful uses of the public way shall be at the cost and expense of the grantee.
               Within 30 days after completion of the make-ready survey identifying the routes of
               the system, the grantee shall apply for all additional licenses from the state, county,
               or other necessary parties, such as the railroads for crossing under or over their
               property. In any event, all necessary applications for permits, licenses, certificates
               and authorizations shall be applied for in a timely fashion so that such filing and
               processing shall not interfere with or cause delay with the construction scheduled
               as outlined in the franchise. Failure to make such timely application and timely filing
               shall constitute a substantial violation of this chapter.
