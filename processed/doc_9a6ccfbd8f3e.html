               after notice to the registered owner or person entitled to possession of the vehicle.
               In the case of a nuisance or junked vehicle, if the names and mailing addresses of
               the registered owner or person entitled to the possession of the vehicle, or the owner,
               lessee, or occupant of the real property upon which the vehicle is located can be
               ascertained in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the notice shall be given by
               first class mail. A written record of the mailing, including the date mailed, shall
               be retained. If such name and address cannot be ascertained or if the vehicle to be
               removed is an abandoned motor vehicle, notice shall be given by affixing on the windshield
               or some other conspicuous place on the vehicle a notice indicating that the vehicle
               will be removed by the county on a specific date no sooner than seven days after the
               notice is affixed or mailed, unless the vehicle is moved by the owner or legal possessor
               prior to that time.

               This notice shall be the responsibility of the planning director. The notice will
               also state that the property owner is allowed seven days to file an appeal in writing
               to the planning director. At the time that an appeal is filed, all enforcement actions
               will be stayed and the planning director will notify the clerk to the board of commissioners
               that an appeal has been filed. The commissioners will hear the appeal at the next
               available regularly scheduled meeting. The commissioners will then decide if the property
               in question is in violation of this article and determine if the vehicle should be
               removed by the county.
