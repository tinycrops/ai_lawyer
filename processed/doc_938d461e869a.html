               only with the issuance of a permit shall be made to the county manager on forms supplied

               to the applicant, or a permit is revoked, the applicant or permit holder shall be
               entitled to a prompt informal hearing with the county manager upon submission of a
               written request. Any person aggrieved by a matter regulated by this section may submit
               to the county manager written comments, including requests for appropriate relief.
               Any person still aggrieved after the county manager has heard the person's plea may
               appeal to the board of commissioners by requesting the clerk to the board to place
               him on the next agenda for a regular board of commissioner's meeting. Any person still
               aggrieved may then appeal to the court of competent jurisdiction.
