               At any stage in the proceedings, including before the probable cause hearing, the
               owner, upon showing proof of ownership, may obtain possession of the removed vehicle
               by paying the towing fee and any storage charges, or by posting a bond for double
               the amount of such fees and charges to the tow truck operator or county having custody
               of the removed vehicle. Upon retaining possession of a vehicle, the owner entitled
               to the possession of the vehicle shall not allow or engage in further violations of
               this chapter.
