               At the public hearing held pursuant to this article, the board of commissioners shall
               hear all interested persons who appear with respect to the preliminary assessment
               roll. At or after the hearing, the board shall annul, modify or confirm the assessments,
               in whole or in part, either by confirming the preliminary assessment roll or by cancelling,
               increasing or reducing the assessments as may be proper in compliance with the basis
               of assessment. If any property is found to be omitted from the preliminary assessment
               roll, the board may place it on the roll and make the proper assessment. When the
               board confirms assessments for a project, the clerk to the board shall enter in the
               minutes of the board the date, hour, and minute of confirmation. From the time of
               confirmation, each assessment is a lien on the property assessed of the same nature
               and to the same extent as the lien for county property taxes, under the priorities
               set out in G.S. 153A-200.
