               911 (E-911) emergency response project. The system standardizes each address throughout
               the county into a three-part physical locationâ€”a house number, street name, and community
               nameâ€”which is compatible with E-911 technology. Each physical address is unique and
               permanent for a specific location. The system allows for an orderly increasing progression
               of numbers from the center of the county and excludes existing municipal numbering
               boundaries.

               <span class="ital">Base numbering grid.</span> The address system utilizes digitized planimetric maps scaled at one inch equals
               1,600 feet that are based on the state plane coordinate system and which were provided
               by Duke Power. Using the state plane coordinate system grids, 1,000-foot blocks were
               set up starting at 1,000 for the beginning point at the geographical center of the
               county and increasing by 100 in the four compass directions. Beginning ranges for
               each road in the county's jurisdiction were established by directly reading the block
               scale and interpolating to the nearest foot interval.

               Depending on the major tending compass direction of the road, either a north-south
               or east-west axis is drawn on the corresponding tax map, and the beginning range is
               attached to this reference line. From this reference line all buildings are assigned
               a number at an interval of one number every ten feet. This allows 100 numbers per
               1,000-foot block, which is sufficient to allow for growth. Even numbers are assigned
               on the north and east sides of a road, and odd numbers are assigned on the south and
               west sides of a road.

               Curvilinear (winding) roads are numbered with a simple axis rotation at the property
               boundary of two parcels of land at the greatest bend in the road. Often several rotations
               are necessary on some of the more winding roads in the county. The odd and even sides
               of a road are relatively maintained the entire length of the road so that only one
               side of a road is even and one side is odd.

               <span class="ital">Municipal coordination.</span> In the fall of 1986, the county and some of the municipalities located within the
               county signed agreements establishing numbering areas located in and around the perimeter
               of each city. These boundaries were established to avoid duplications of numbers on
               any street and allow the cities to make a progressive effort to resolve existing numbering
               problems located within the city limits as well as allow them to number areas slated
               for future annexations. By contract, the participating cities are responsible for
               the assignment and maintenance of house numbers within their numbering area. Municipalities
               participating in numbering boundary agreements include Brookford, Catawba, Conover,
               Hickory, Long View, Maiden, and Newton. The City of Claremont elected to adopt the
               county's numbering system and will be numbered and maintained by the county.
