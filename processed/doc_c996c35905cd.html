               For building construction projects costing more than $300,000.00 the owner can only
               use the following statutory authorized construction methods. The owner may choose,
               at its discretion, the specific method it wishes to use (G.S. 143-128).

                  bidder for each category of work for which separate specifications are required. Each
                  contractor is directly responsible to the owner and to the other contactors for full
                  performance of his/her contract.

                  to the lowest responsive, responsible bidder, and the general contractor contracts
                  with subcontractors for branches or divisions of work on the project. The bidders
                  must identify on their bids the subcontractors for HVAC, electrical, plumbing, and
                  general work. Once the contract is awarded, the general contractor is directly responsible
                  to the owner, and subcontractors are directly responsible to the general contractor.

                  same project and then award the contract to the lowest responsive, responsible bidder
                  in either category. In determining whether to award on a separate-prime or single-prime
                  basis, the owner may consider the costs of construction oversight, time for completion,
                  and other factors it deems appropriate.

                  <span class="ital">Construction management at risk (CM@R).</span> Under a construction management at risk contract, the construction manager, who must
                  be a licensed general contractor, provides construction management services such as
                  preparing and coordinating bid packages and construction administration, and guarantees
                  the cost of the project. The construction manager at risk acts as the fiduciary of
                  the owner in handling and opening bids and awarding contracts. While the construction
                  manager manages the project, plans and specifications must be drawn by a licensed
                  architect or engineer who contracts directly with the owner. The construction manager
                  at risk contract is covered by the Mini-Brooks Act and must be selected using the
                  qualification based selection method (G.S. 143-1289.1, G.S. 143-64.31â€”32).

                  <span class="ital">Design-build (DB) and design-build bridging (DBB).</span> Under these construction delivery methods, the design-builder contracts to provide
                  both design services (architectural and engineering) and construction services under
                  one contract. A design-build contract is subject to a specific statutory request for
                  qualification process and the design-builder is initially selected based on qualifications,
                  not estimated costs of the contract. Consistent with the Mini-Brooks Act (G.S. 143-64.31),
                  contract costs can only be negotiated once the best qualified design-builder is initially
                  selected (G.S. 143-128.1A).

                  A Design-build bridging contract differs from a design-build contract in two primary
                  ways. First the owner contracts separately with a project designer to design 35 percent
                  of the project and contracts with a design-builder to complete the project design
                  and perform construction services. Second, the design-build contract is awarded to
                  the lowest responsive, responsible bidder based on estimated costs of performing general
                  contract conditions, design services, and construction service. Design-builders submit
                  these cost estimates with their bids (G.S. 143-128.1B).

                  develop a capital construction project. The developer is selected on qualifications
                  through a competitive request for qualifications process and is required to finance
                  at least 50 percent of the project cost (G.S. 143.1C).

                  repair contracts costing $300,000.00 or more if approved by the state building commission
                  or by legislative action. Alternative construction methods can be used for building
                  construction and repair projects costing less than $300,000.00 as well as all non-building
                  construction and repair projects regardless of cost (G.S. 143-128(a1)(5), G.S. 143-135.26(9).
