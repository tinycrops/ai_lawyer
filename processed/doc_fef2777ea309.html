               Unless proof of a current rabies vaccination can be furnished, every person who either
               adopts or redeems a dog or cat at the animal shelter will be given a proof of rabies
               vaccination card at the time of the redemption or adoption. This card will be stamped
               with a date stating the maximum time limit allowed to take the dog or cat to the veterinarian
               of such person's choice for rabies vaccination. The time limit for dogs and cats four
               months and older will be 72 hours, with Sundays and holidays excluded. For puppies
