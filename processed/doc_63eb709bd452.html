               The board of commissioners finds that the conditions causing flooding result in high
               and swift waters, which with debris, make the recreational, commercial or navigational
               use of rivers dangerous and hazardous. The board of commissioners also finds imminent
               flood conditions contribute to a threat of property and personal injury in those rivers
               areas and that, therefore, there exists a need to ban the presence of persons from
               waters and waterways during flood or imminent flood conditions. This article is required
               in furtherance of the public health, safety and welfare.
