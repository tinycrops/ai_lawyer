               It is the policy of the county to require the co-location of wireless communication
               facilities on existing towers and electric transmission towers. In furtherance of
               this policy, the following will apply:

                  On or before November 15 of each year, or the following Monday should November 15
                  fall on a weekend, every person, corporation, partnership or other entity who intends
                  to erect wireless communications facilities within the jurisdiction of this article
                  shall submit to the ordinance administrator a preliminary plan which shall contain
                  information as to the height, size, types, purpose, general location and reason for
                  erection of every wireless communications facility anticipated to be erected during
                  the following year, including an inventory of all wireless communication facilities,
                  as well as verification of continued compliance with FCC and FAA requirements. Additionally,
                  there shall be provided the name, address and telephone number of an individual designated
                  as the point of contact with the ordinance administrator for discussion and resolution
                  of wireless communications facility issues. Changes or additions to this information
                  shall be submitted during the year as appropriate. The ordinance administrator shall
                  send notice of this requirement to all wireless communication companies and tower
                  owners known to operate within the county. No permit shall be issued to a company
                  or owner failing to comply with the provisions of this section.

                  Upon receipt of such plan, the ordinance administrator shall promptly review them
                  and proceed to communicate with the designated points of contact in an effort to maximize
                  co-location and avoid the placement of towers in highly objectionable areas or near
                  existing facilities. If the ordinance administrator determines it to be appropriate,
                  he is empowered by this article to convene a mandatory conference to which all parties
                  who have submitted plans will be required to send a representative, subject to the
                  requirement that a minimum of five working days notice be given as to the specific
                  time and place of such conference. The purpose of such conference will be to discuss
                  co-location on towers and any other issues pertaining to telecommunications towers
                  which the ordinance administrator determines to be pertinent. The conference shall
                  be open to the public, but the ordinance administrator shall have the authority to
                  limit public comment as he deems necessary to assure an orderly consideration of the
                  agenda. In considering applications for individual wireless communications facility
                  permits, the ordinance administrator shall require any applicant who has failed to
                  include a proposed tower in its preliminary plan or has failed to have a representative
                  present at a mandatory conference to submit in writing a satisfactory explanation
                  for such failure prior to the issuance of a permit. The ordinance administrator shall
                  render a written decision which sets forth with particularity such findings of fact
                  as necessary to show whether the applicant's explanation is or is not satisfactory.
