               Each youth athletic playing district which participates in three or more county youth
               sporting leagues (presently baseball, softball, football, basketball and indoor soccer,
               but which may change from time to time) is entitled to have a member representative
               appointed to the commission. If a youth athletic playing district meets those criteria,
               it may petition to have a representative appointed by the board of commissioners.
               If the board of commissioners determines that the youth athletic playing district
               meets the criteria, the board of commissioners will appoint a representative as provided
               in subsection (a) of this section. If a youth athletic playing district should cease
               to participate in the minimum number of county youth sports leagues, then that youth
               athletic playing district shall lose its representation on the commission and its
               representative shall be removed by action of the board of commissioners.

               of commissioners and its replacement by another organization, or by any other circumstances,
               then the board of commissioners may remove the representative of the youth athletic
