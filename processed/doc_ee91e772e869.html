               The provisions of Art. V, Â§Â§ 58-101â€”58-116, have been repealed at the direction of
               the city. The former provisions of Art. V pertained to multifamily dwellings, and
               derived from Ord. No. 07-05-02, adopted May 1, 2007. The N.C. Court of Appeals ruled
               that Ord. No. 07-05-02 was not passed in accordance with the statutory requirements
               of N.C.G.S. Â§ 153A-323 (the predecessor of N.C.G.S. Â§ 160D-601), and therefore was
               invalid. (See Case #(COA08-229, 17 March 2009); Thrash Ltd. Partnership v. County of Buncombe, 673 S.E.2d 689, (N.C. App., 2009)).
