               systems shall be monitored by the county health department for environmental impact
               on surface waters at a minimum of once per year. Systems out of compliance with effluent
               limitations established with the state administrative code shall be reported to the
               state department of environment, health, and natural resources for enforcement action.
               In addition, these systems shall be monitored by the county health department at least
               twice within a six-month period after the deadline imposed for compliance by the department
               of natural resources and community development to ensure that compliance has been
               obtained. If, at either of these two monitoring inspections, the system is found to
               be out of compliance with the applicable requirements cited above, then the party
               in violation thereof shall be punished as provided in G.S. 130A-25.
