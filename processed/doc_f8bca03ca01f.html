               Complaints or orders issued by the chief building inspector shall be served upon persons
               either personally or by registered or certified mail. If the whereabouts of such persons
               are unknown and their whereabouts cannot be ascertained by the chief building inspector
               in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the chief building inspector shall make an
               affidavit to that effect, and the servicing of such complaint or order upon such person
               may be made by publishing the complaint or order once each week for two successive
               weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in the county. Where service is made
               by publication, a notice of the pending proceedings shall be posted in a conspicuous
               place on the premises affected by the complaint or order.
