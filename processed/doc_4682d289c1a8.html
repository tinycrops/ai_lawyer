               management director and his subordinates or law enforcement officers when directed
               in the declaration to do so by the chairperson. When acting under this authority,

               to any area, street, highway or location within the county if that restriction or
               denial of access or use is reasonably necessary to promote efforts being made to overcome
               the emergency or to prevent further aggravation of the emergency.
