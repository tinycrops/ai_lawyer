               of its noncompliance. Ways that impact may be reduced include protecting the structure

               building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
               rehabilitation, addition or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The

               the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basements,

               ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration
               affects the external dimensions of the building.
