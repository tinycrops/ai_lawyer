               in collecting sales and use taxes, designates the county manager, or his designee,
               to act as deputy for the purpose of compromising or forgiving for good cause shown
               any penalty or additional tax imposed herein, and for conducting any hearings and
               making decisions to determine the validity of a tax imposed by the tax assessor. If
               a taxpayer claims that a tax, additional tax, penalty or interest is excessive, a
               notice of appeal must be filed by the taxpayer within thirty (30) days after the final
               notice of the tax assessor is mailed or personally delivered to the taxpayer as provided
               in subsection (i) of this section. The final decision of the deputy shall be made
               and mailed or delivered to the taxpayer within thirty (30) days after the hearing.
               The taxpayer shall pay the tax, additional tax, penalty or interest without prejudice
               to any defense the taxpayer has. The taxpayer may file suit for a refund in the superior
               court of the county pursuant to the provisions of G.S. Â§ 105-267.
