               The purpose of the chapter is to promote agricultural values and the general welfare
               of the county; increase identity and pride in the agricultural community and its way
               of life; support the economic and financial health of agriculture; increase protection
               from nonfarm development and other negative impacts on properly managed farms; and
               decrease the likelihood of legal disputes, such as nuisance actions between farm owners
               and their neighbors.
