               In lieu of the procedures set forth in the remaining sections of this article, the
               subdivider may apply for final approval for any minor subdivision through the procedure
               set forth herein. This procedure is designed to eliminate the requirement for submission
               of a preliminary plat, thus allowing the subdivider to submit only the final plat
               for approval. The final plat for a minor subdivision shall be subject to all development
               requirements of this chapter.

                  Plats for minor subdivisions may be given final approval by the planning director
