               Whenever, in the opinion of the county sheriff, there is good cause to revoke a license
               acquired under this article, he shall submit a written recommendation of revocation,
               stating the reasons therefor, to the board of commissioners, and by registered mail
               shall forward to the licensee a copy of his recommendation. The board of commissioners
               shall thereupon be authorized to revoke such license if, in its sound discretion,
               it is deemed in the best interest of the health, safety, welfare or morals of the
               people of the county.
