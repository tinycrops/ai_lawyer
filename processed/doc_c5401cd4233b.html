               Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this
               article and shall achieve compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards
               within the time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations.
               Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the county
               shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans
               showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to
               the county for review, and shall be acceptable to the county before construction of
               the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve
               the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce
               an effluent acceptable to the county under the provisions of this article. Any subsequent
               changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to
               and be acceptable to the county prior to the user's initiation of the changes.
