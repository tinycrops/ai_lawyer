               and work therein for which a permit of any kind has been issued as often as necessary
               in order to determine whether the work complies with this article and the appropriate
               codes. When deemed necessary by the appropriate inspector, materials and assemblies
               may be inspected at the point of manufacture or fabrication, or inspections may be
               made by approved and recognized inspection organizations; provided, however, that
               no approval shall be based upon reports of such organizations unless the same are
               in writing and certified by a responsible officer of such organization. All holders
               of permits, or their agents, shall notify the department of permits and inspections
               and the appropriate inspector at each of the following stages of construction so that
