Rainey Chairman ____________ Tom Sobol, Vice Chairman Patsy Keever, Commissioner William Stanley, Commissioner David Young, Commissioner Board of Commissioners ____________ William E. McElrath, Jr. County Manager ____________ Joe A. Connolly, County Attorney Keith S. Snyder, Associate County Attorney Legal ____________ Kathy Hughes Clerk to the Board PREFACE This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances\nof Buncombe County, North Carolina. Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances and resolutions\nadopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the\nhistory note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note\nindicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption\nof the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code,\nthe reader can locate any ordinance included herein. The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and\nthe various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage.\nNotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant\nstate law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting\nforth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. Chapter and Section Numbering System The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used\nin many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts\nseparated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and\nthe figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter.\nThus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the\nsame time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal\nsystem for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that\nwould logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new\nsection would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in\nthe same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter\nembracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of\nthe article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to\nthe new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved\nchapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters\nis maintained when including new chapters. Page Numbering System The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the\nleft of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume.\nThe number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion.\nIn the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates\nthe number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately\nto the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical\nparts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time,\nand their corresponding prefixes: CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1 Index The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been\nplaced under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others\nin legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government\nofficials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself\nwhich stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user\nis interested. Looseleaf Supplements A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental\nservicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date.\nSubsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or\npages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies\nof the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and\ndeleting the obsolete pages. Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder\nof the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility\nof the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions.\nIt is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately\nupon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be\nsaved and filed for historical reference purposes. Acknowledgments This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor,\nand Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.\nCredit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their\nsincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Kathy Hughes, Clerk to the Board of Commissioners,\nand Mr. Keith Snyder, Associate County Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance\nduring the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts\nand those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the\nactive law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable\ntool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

The source of each section is included in the\n            history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note\n            indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption\n            of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code,\n            the reader can locate any ordinance included herein.\n            <\/p><p class=\"p0\">\n            The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and\n            the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage.\n            Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant\n            state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting\n            forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.\n            <\/p><p class=\"bc0\">\n            <span class=\"ital\">Chapter and Section Numbering System<\/span>\n            <\/p><p class=\"p0\">\n            The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used\n            in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts\n            separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and\n            the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter.\n            Thus, the second section of<a href=\"\" data-chunk-id=\"COOR_CH1GEPR\" class=\"section-link\" data-product-id=\"12776\"> chapter 1<\/a> is numbered 1-2, and the first section of<a href=\"\" data-chunk-id=\"COOR_CH6AN\" class=\"section-link\" data-product-id=\"12776\"> chapter 6<\/a> is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the\n            same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal\n            system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that\n            would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new\n            section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in\n            the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter\n            embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of\n            the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to\n            the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved\n            chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters\n            is maintained when including new chapters.\n            <\/p><p class=\"bc0\">\n            <span class=\"ital\">Page Numbering System<\/span>\n            <\/p><p class=\"p0\">\n            The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the\n            left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume.\n            The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion.\n            In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates\n            the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately\n            to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical\n            parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time,\n            and their corresponding prefixes:\n            \n            <div>\n               <div class=\"\" style=\"width:100%\">\n                  <table class=\" left\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" rules=\"all\">\n                     <colgroup class=\"std\">\n                        <col width=\"50%\">\n                        <col width=\"50%\">\n                     <\/colgroup>\n                     <tbody>\n                        <tr>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              CODE\n                              <\/td>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              CD1:1\n                              <\/td>\n                        <\/tr>\n                        <tr>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              CODE APPENDIX\n                              <\/td>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              CDA:1\n                              <\/td>\n                        <\/tr>\n                        <tr>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE\n                              <\/td>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              CCT:1\n                              <\/td>\n                        <\/tr>\n                        <tr>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE\n                              <\/td>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              SLT:1\n                              <\/td>\n                        <\/tr>\n                        <tr>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              CODE INDEX\n                              <\/td>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              CDi:1\n                              <\/td>\n                        <\/tr>\n                     <\/tbody>\n                  <\/table>\n               <\/div>\n               <p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n            <p class=\"bc0\">\n            <span class=\"ital\">Index<\/span>\n            <\/p><p class=\"p0\">\n            The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been\n            placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others\n            in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government\n            officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself\n            which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user\n            is interested.\n            <\/p><p class=\"bc0\">\n            <span class=\"ital\">Looseleaf Supplements<\/span>\n            <\/p><p class=\"p0\">\n            A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental\n            servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date.\n            Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or\n            pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies\n            of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and\n            deleting the obsolete pages.\n            <\/p><p class=\"p0\">\n            Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder\n            of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility\n            of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions.\n            It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately\n            upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be\n            saved and filed for historical reference purposes.\n            <\/p><p class=\"bc0\">\n            <span class=\"ital\">Acknowledgments<\/span>\n            <\/p><p class=\"p0\">\n            This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor,\n            and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.\n            Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their\n            sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.\n            <\/p><p class=\"p0\">\n            The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Kathy Hughes, Clerk to the Board of Commissioners,\n            and Mr. Keith Snyder, Associate County Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance\n            during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts\n            and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the\n            active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable\n            tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.\n            <\/p><p class=\"bc0\">\n            <span class=\"ital\">Copyright<\/span>\n            <\/p><p class=\"p0\">\n            All editorial enhancements of this Code are copyrighted by Municipal Code Corporation\n            and Buncombe County, North Carolina.

Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1993 Code and ordinances\nsubsequently adopted by the board of commissioners. The source of each section is\nincluded in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence\nof such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time\nwith the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back\nof this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1993 Code and any subsequent\nordinance included herein. The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and\nthe various sections within each chapter have been provided catchlines to facilitate\nusage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant\nstate law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting\nforth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. Chapter and Section Numbering System The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used\nin many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts\nseparated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and\nthe figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter.\nThus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1 . Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same\ntime new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system\nfor amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would\nlogically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and\nnew divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be\nplaced at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions,\nmay be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive\nnumber shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included\nby using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical\narrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. Page Numbering System The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the\nleft of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume.\nThe number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion.\nIn the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates\nthe number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately\nto the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical\nparts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time,\nand their corresponding prefixes: CHARTER CHT:1 RELATED LAWS RL:1 SESSION LAWS SL:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 RELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE RLCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE APPENDIX CDA:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1 Index The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been\nplaced under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others\nin legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government\nofficials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself\nwhich stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user\nis interested. Looseleaf Supplements A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental\nservicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to\ndate. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected\npage or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of\ncopies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages\nand deleting the obsolete pages. Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder\nof the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility\nof the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions.\nIt is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately\nupon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be\nsaved and filed for historical reference purposes. Acknowledgments This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel F. Walker, Code Attorney,\nand Ramona Connors, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.\nCredit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their\nsincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. The publisher is most grateful to Kay Draughn, Clerk to the Board, for her cooperation\nand assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that\nher efforts, those of other county officials, and those of the publisher have resulted\nin a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the county readily accessible\nto all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration\nof the county's affairs.

These new pages will be distributed to holders of\n            copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages\n            and deleting the obsolete pages.\n            \n         <\/p><p class=\"p0\">\n            Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder\n            of the publication.

Koch County Attorney ____________ Michael K. Downs County Manager ____________ Megan I. E. Smit Clerk to the Board of Commissioners PREFACE This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances\nof Cabarrus County, North Carolina. Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by\nthe board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history\nnote appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates\nthat the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the\nCode. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader\ncan locate any ordinance included herein. The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and\nthe various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage.\nNotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant\nstate law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting\nforth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. Chapter and Section Numbering System The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used\nin many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts\nseparated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and\nthe figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter.\nThus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the\nsame time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal\nsystem for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that\nwould logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new\nsection would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in\nthe same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter\nembracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of\nthe article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to\nthe new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved\nchapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters\nis maintained when including new chapters. Page Numbering System The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the\nleft of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume.\nThe number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion.\nIn the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates\nthe number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately\nto the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical\nparts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time,\nand their corresponding prefixes: SPECIAL ACTS SA:1 SPECIAL ACTS COMPARATIVE TABLE SACT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 SPECIAL ACTS INDEX SAi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1 Indexes The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has\nbeen placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology,\nothers in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local\ngovernment officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the\nindexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular\nitem in which the user is interested. Looseleaf Supplements A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental\nservicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date.\nSubsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or\npages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies\nof the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and\ndeleting the obsolete pages. Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder\nof the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility\nof the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions.\nIt is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately\nupon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be\nsaved and filed for historical reference purposes. Acknowledgments This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor,\nand Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.\nCredit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their\nsincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Frankie F. Bonds, Clerk to the Board of Commissioners,\nand Mr. Fletcher L. Hartsell, Jr., County Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance\nduring the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts\nand those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the\nactive law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable\ntool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.

The source of each section is included in the history\n            note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates\n            that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the\n            Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader\n            can locate any ordinance included herein.\n            \n         <\/p><p class=\"p0\">\n            The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and\n            the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage.\n            Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant\n            state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting\n            forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.\n            \n         <\/p><p class=\"bc0\">\n            <span class=\"ital\">Chapter and Section Numbering System<\/span>\n            \n         <\/p><p class=\"p0\">\n            The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used\n            in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts\n            separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and\n            the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter.\n            Thus, the second section of<a href=\"\" data-chunk-id=\"PTIICOOR_CH1GEPR\" class=\"section-link\" data-product-id=\"12658\"> chapter 1<\/a> is numbered 1-2, and the first section of<a href=\"\" data-chunk-id=\"PTIICOOR_CH6AMEN\" class=\"section-link\" data-product-id=\"12658\"> chapter 6<\/a> is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the\n            same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal\n            system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that\n            would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new\n            section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in\n            the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter\n            embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of\n            the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to\n            the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved\n            chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters\n            is maintained when including new chapters.\n            \n         <\/p><p class=\"bc0\">\n            <span class=\"ital\">Page Numbering System<\/span>\n            \n         <\/p><p class=\"p0\">\n            The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the\n            left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume.\n            The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion.\n            In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates\n            the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately\n            to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical\n            parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time,\n            and their corresponding prefixes:\n            \n            <div>\n               <div class=\"\" style=\"width:100%\">\n                  <table class=\"thead0 table  left\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" rules=\"all\">\n                     <colgroup class=\"std\">\n                        <col width=\"50%\">\n                        <col width=\"50%\">\n                     <\/colgroup>\n                     <tbody>\n                        <tr>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              SPECIAL ACTS\n                              \n                           <\/td>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              SA:1\n                              \n                           <\/td>\n                        <\/tr>\n                        <tr>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              SPECIAL ACTS COMPARATIVE TABLE\n                              \n                           <\/td>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              SACT:1\n                              \n                           <\/td>\n                        <\/tr>\n                        <tr>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              CODE\n                              \n                           <\/td>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              CD1:1\n                              \n                           <\/td>\n                        <\/tr>\n                        <tr>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE\n                              \n                           <\/td>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              CCT:1\n                              \n                           <\/td>\n                        <\/tr>\n                        <tr>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE\n                              \n                           <\/td>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              SLT:1\n                              \n                           <\/td>\n                        <\/tr>\n                        <tr>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              SPECIAL ACTS INDEX\n                              \n                           <\/td>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              SAi:1\n                              \n                           <\/td>\n                        <\/tr>\n                        <tr>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              CODE INDEX\n                              \n                           <\/td>\n                           <td class=\" top \">\n                              CDi:1\n                              \n                           <\/td>\n                        <\/tr>\n                     <\/tbody>\n                  <\/table>\n               <\/div>\n               <p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n            <\/div>\n            \n         <p class=\"bc0\">\n            <span class=\"ital\">Indexes<\/span>\n            \n         <\/p><p class=\"p0\">\n            The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has\n            been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology,\n            others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local\n            government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the\n            indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular\n            item in which the user is interested.\n            \n         <\/p><p class=\"bc0\">\n            <span class=\"ital\">Looseleaf Supplements<\/span>\n            \n         <\/p><p class=\"p0\">\n            A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental\n            servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date.\n            Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or\n            pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies\n            of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and\n            deleting the obsolete pages.\n            \n         <\/p><p class=\"p0\">\n            Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder\n            of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility\n            of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions.\n            It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately\n            upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be\n            saved and filed for historical reference purposes.\n            \n         <\/p><p class=\"bc0\">\n            <span class=\"ital\">Acknowledgments<\/span>\n            \n         <\/p><p class=\"p0\">\n            This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor,\n            and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.\n            Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their\n            sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.\n            \n         <\/p><p class=\"p0\">\n            The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Frankie F.
