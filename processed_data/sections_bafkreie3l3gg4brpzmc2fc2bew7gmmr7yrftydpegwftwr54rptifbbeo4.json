A member of the Buncombe County Board of Commissioners shall not vote on any legislative\n               decision where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to\n               have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on the member.\n               A governing board member shall not vote on any zoning amendment if the landowner of\n               the property subject to a rezoning petition or the applicant for a text amendment\n               is a person with whom the member has a close familial, business, or other associational\n               relationship.\n               \n\n               (b)\n               \n\nAppointed boards. Members of appointed boards shall not vote on any advisory or legislative decision\n               where the outcome of the matter being considered is reasonably likely to have a direct,\n               substantial, and readily identifiable financial impact on the member. An appointed\n               board member shall not vote on any zoning amendment if the landowner of the property\n               subject to a rezoning petition or the applicant for a text amendment is a person with\n               whom the member has a close familial, business, or other associational relationship.\n               \n\n               (c)\n               \n\nAdministrative staff. No staff member shall make a final decision on an administrative decision if the\n               outcome of that decision would have a direct, substantial, and readily identifiable\n               financial impact on the staff member or if the applicant or other person subject to\n               that decision is a person with whom the staff member has a close familial, business,\n               or other associational relationship. If a staff member has a conflict of interest,\n               the decision shall be assigned to the supervisor of the staff person. No staff member\n               shall be financially interested or employed by a business that is financially interested\n               in an undertaking subject to regulation under this Code of Ordinances, unless the\n               staff member is the owner property involved. No staff member or other individual or\n               an employee of a company contracting with a local government to provide staff support\n               shall engage in any work that is inconsistent with his or her duties or with the interest\n               of the local government, as determined by the local government.\n               \n\n               (d)\n               \n\nQuasi-judicial decisions.

Impermissible violations of due process include, but are not limited to, a\n               member having a fixed opinion prior to hearing the matter that is not susceptible\n               to change, undisclosed ex parte communications, a close familial, business, or other\n               associational relationship with an affected person, or a financial interest in the\n               outcome of the matter.\n               \n\n               (e)\n               \n\nResolution of objection. If an objection is raised to a board member's participation at or prior to the hearing\n               or vote on a particular matter and that member does not recuse himself or herself,\n               the remaining members of the board shall by majority vote rule on the objection.\n               \n\n               (f)\n               \n\nFamilial relationship.
