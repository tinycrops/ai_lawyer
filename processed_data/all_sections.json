The source of each section is included in the\n            history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note\n            indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption\n            of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code,\n            the reader can locate any ordinance included herein.\n            \n            The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and\n            the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage.\n            Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant\n            state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting\n            forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.\n            \nChapter and Section Numbering System\n\n            The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used\n            in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts\n            separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and\n            the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter.\n            Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the\n            same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal\n            system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that\n            would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new\n            section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in\n            the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter\n            embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of\n            the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to\n            the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved\n            chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters\n            is maintained when including new chapters.\n            \nPage Numbering System\n\n            The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the\n            left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume.\n            The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion.\n            In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates\n            the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately\n            to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix.

Each particular item has been\n            placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others\n            in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government\n            officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself\n            which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user\n            is interested.\n            \nLooseleaf Supplements\n\n            A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental\n            servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date.\n            Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or\n            pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies\n            of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and\n            deleting the obsolete pages.\n            \n            Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder\n            of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility\n            of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions.\n            It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately\n            upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be\n            saved and filed for historical reference purposes.\n            \nAcknowledgments\n\n            This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor,\n            and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.\n            Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their\n            sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.\n            \n            The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Kathy Hughes, Clerk to the Board of Commissioners,\n            and Mr. Keith Snyder, Associate County Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance\n            during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts\n            and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the\n            active law of the county readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable\n            tool in the day-to-day administration of the county's affairs.\n            \nCopyright\n\n            All editorial enhancements of this Code are copyrighted by Municipal Code Corporation\n            and Buncombe County, North Carolina.

The Code entitled \"Code of Ordinances, Buncombe County, North Carolina\" published\n            by Municipal Code Corporation consisting of Chapters 1 through 78, each inclusive, is adopted.\n            \nSection 2. All Ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted on or before March 21, 1995,\n            and not included in the Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein,\n            are repealed.\n            \nSection 3. The repeal provided for in section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any\n            ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance that is\n            repealed by this ordinance.\n            \nSection 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided, every person convicted of a violation\n            of any provision of the Code or any ordinance, rule or regulation adopted or issued\n            in pursuance thereof, shall be punished as provided in G.S. 14-4. Each act of violation\n            and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate\n            offense. The penalty provided by this section, unless another penalty is expressly\n            provided shall apply to the amendment of any Code section whether or not such penalty\n            is reenacted in the amendatory ordinance. In addition to the penalty prescribed above,\n            the County may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief,\n            and revocation of licenses or permits.\n            \nSection 5. Additions or amendments to the Code when passed in the form as to indicate the intention\n            of the Board of Commissioners to make the same a part of the Code shall be deemed\n            to be incorporated in the Code, so that reference to the Code included the additions\n            and amendments.\n            \nSection 6. Ordinances adopted after March 21, 1995 that amend or refer to ordinances that have\n            been codified in the Code, shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions\n            of the Code.\n            \nSection 7. This ordinance shall become effective October 1, 1995.\n            \n            Passed and adopted by the Board of Commissioners this the 5th day of September, 1995\n            by a unanimous vote.\n            \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              ATTEST\n                              \n\n                              BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS\n                              \n                              FOR BUNCOMBE COUNTY\n                              \n\n\n\n                              \/s\/\n                              \n                                 \u00e2\u20ac\u201aKATHY HUGHES\n                                 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n                              CLERK\n                              \n\n                              BY:\u00e2\u20ac\u201a\/s\/\n                              \n                                 \u00e2\u20ac\u201aGENE RAINEY\n                                 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n                              CHAIRMAN\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n            APPROVED AS TO FORM\n            \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\/s\/ \n                              JOE CONNOLLY\n                              \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n                              COUNTY ATTORNEY\n                              \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n            Certificate of Adoption\n            \n            I hereby certify that the foregoing is a true copy of the ordinance passed at the\n            regular meeting of the board of commissioners of the County of Buncombe, North Carolina\n            held on the 5th day of September, 1995.\n            \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\/s\/ \n                              Kathy Hughes\n                              \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n                              Clerk to the Board"}

The source of each section is\n            included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence\n            of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time\n            with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back\n            of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1993 Code and any subsequent\n            ordinance included herein.\n            \n         \n            The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and\n            the various sections within each chapter have been provided catchlines to facilitate\n            usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant\n            state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting\n            forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.\n            \n         \nChapter and Section Numbering System\n\n            The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used\n            in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts\n            separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and\n            the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter.\n            Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same\n            time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system\n            for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would\n            logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and\n            new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be\n            placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions,\n            may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive\n            number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included\n            by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical\n            arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters.\n            \n         \nPage Numbering System\n\n            The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the\n            left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume.\n            The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion.\n            In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates\n            the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately\n            to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical\n            parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time,\n            and their corresponding prefixes:\n            \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              CHARTER\n                              \n                           \n\n                              CHT:1\n                              \n                           \n\n\n\n                              RELATED LAWS\n                              \n                           \n\n                              RL:1\n                              \n                           \n\n\n\n                              SESSION LAWS\n                              \n                           \n\n                              SL:1\n                              \n                           \n\n\n\n                              CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE\n                              \n                           \n\n                              CHTCT:1\n                              \n                           \n\n\n\n                              RELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE\n                              \n                           \n\n                              RLCT:1\n                              \n                           \n\n\n\n                              CODE\n                              \n                           \n\n                              CD1:1\n                              \n                           \n\n\n\n                              CODE APPENDIX\n                              \n                           \n\n                              CDA:1\n                              \n                           \n\n\n\n                              CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES\n                              \n                           \n\n                              CCT:1\n                              \n                           \n\n\n\n                              STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE\n                              \n                           \n\n                              SLT:1\n                              \n                           \n\n\n\n                              CHARTER INDEX\n                              \n                           \n\n                              CHTi:1\n                              \n                           \n\n\n\n                              CODE INDEX\n                              \n                           \n\n                              CDi:1\n                              \n                           \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIndex\n\n            The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been\n            placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others\n            in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government\n            officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself\n            which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user\n            is interested.\n            \n         \nLooseleaf Supplements\n\n            A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental\n            servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to\n            date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected\n            page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of\n            copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages\n            and deleting the obsolete pages.\n            \n         \n            Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder\n            of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility\n            of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions.\n            It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately\n            upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be\n            saved and filed for historical reference purposes.\n            \n         \nAcknowledgments\n\n            This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel F. Walker, Code Attorney,\n            and Ramona Connors, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.\n            Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their\n            sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.\n            \n         \n            The publisher is most grateful to Kay Draughn, Clerk to the Board, for her cooperation\n            and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication.

Smit\n            \n         \nClerk to the Board of Commissioners\n\n            PREFACE\n            \n         \n            This Code constitutes a complete codification of the general and permanent ordinances\n            of Cabarrus County, North Carolina.\n            \n         \n            Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the ordinances adopted by\n            the board of commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history\n            note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates\n            that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the\n            Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader\n            can locate any ordinance included herein.\n            \n         \n            The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and\n            the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage.\n            Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant\n            state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting\n            forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.\n            \n         \nChapter and Section Numbering System\n\n            The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used\n            in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts\n            separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and\n            the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter.\n            Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the\n            same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal\n            system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that\n            would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new\n            section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in\n            the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter\n            embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of\n            the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to\n            the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved\n            chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters\n            is maintained when including new chapters.\n            \n         \nPage Numbering System\n\n            The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the\n            left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume.\n            The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion.\n            In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates\n            the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately\n            to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical\n            parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time,\n            and their corresponding prefixes:\n            \n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                              SPECIAL ACTS\n                              \n                           \n\n                              SA:1\n                              \n                           \n\n\n\n                              SPECIAL ACTS COMPARATIVE TABLE\n                              \n                           \n\n                              SACT:1\n                              \n                           \n\n\n\n                              CODE\n                              \n                           \n\n                              CD1:1\n                              \n                           \n\n\n\n                              CODE COMPARATIVE TABLE\n                              \n                           \n\n                              CCT:1\n                              \n                           \n\n\n\n                              STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE\n                              \n                           \n\n                              SLT:1\n                              \n                           \n\n\n\n                              SPECIAL ACTS INDEX\n                              \n                           \n\n                              SAi:1\n                              \n                           \n\n\n\n                              CODE INDEX\n                              \n                           \n\n                              CDi:1\n                              \n                           \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nIndexes\n\n            The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has\n            been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology,\n            others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local\n            government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the\n            indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular\n            item in which the user is interested.\n            \n         \nLooseleaf Supplements\n\n            A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental\n            servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date.\n            Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or\n            pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies\n            of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and\n            deleting the obsolete pages.\n            \n         \n            Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder\n            of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility\n            of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions.\n            It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately\n            upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be\n            saved and filed for historical reference purposes.\n            \n         \nAcknowledgments\n\n            This publication was under the direct supervision of Jan Shekitka, Supervising Editor,\n            and Robert MacNaughton, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida.\n            Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their\n            sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.\n            \n         \n            The publisher is most grateful to Ms. Frankie F.
